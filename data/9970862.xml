== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors.

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article?

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article?

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

== Less individual products? ==

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

::There were some left (identified with [[User:Anomie/linkclassifier|linkclassifier]]) and I have fixed them. Most of them would have resulted in further duplicate links within the section.

It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:As of September 2014 it now redirects to [[Small appliance]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 12:24, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Less individual products? ==

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki].

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:As of September 2014 it now redirects to [[Small appliance]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 12:24, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Less individual products? ==

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 13:24, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)
:Have now removed tag template as does not seem appropriate to me. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 12:44, 10 September 2014 (UTC)
::There were some left (identified with [[User:Anomie/linkclassifier|linkclassifier]]) and I have fixed them. Most of them would have resulted in further duplicate links within the section. I fixed quite a bit of duplicates, too. CSJJ104 is right about fixing those ([[WP:REPEATLINK]]). Redirects, however, are just fine ([[WP:NOTBROKEN]]).

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:

*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support'''. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

::There were some left (identified with [[User:Anomie/linkclassifier|linkclassifier]]) and I have fixed them. Most of them would have resulted in further duplicate links within the section.

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

::There were some left (identified with [[User:Anomie/linkclassifier|linkclassifier]]) and I have fixed them. Most of them would have resulted in further duplicate links within the section.

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki].

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support'''. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support'''. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

::There were some left (identified with [[User:Anomie/linkclassifier|linkclassifier]]) and I have fixed them. Most of them would have resulted in further duplicate links within the section.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:

*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

::A look at each item in both lists reveals a few date discrepancies discrepancy, invention of the triode and invention of the iconoscope, but otherwise both lists are completely different.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

::A look at each item in both lists reveals a few date discrepancies discrepancy, invention of the triode and invention of the iconoscope, but otherwise both lists are completely different.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

:As of September 2014 it now redirects to [[Small appliance]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 12:24, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

::There were some left (identified with [[User:Anomie/linkclassifier|linkclassifier]]) and I have fixed them. Most of them would have resulted in further duplicate links within the section.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

== Less individual products? ==

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging.

== Less individual products? ==

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Less individual products? ==

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors.

== Less individual products? ==

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*[[Electron tube]]
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Internal links ==

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Electron tube]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Brown goods ==

[[Brown goods]] redirects here, but what does the phrase mean? thanks [[Special:Contributions/80.179.220.87|80.179.220.87]] ([[User talk:80.179.220.87|talk]]) 10:19, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking that myself! I searched for 'brown goods' and like you got redirected with no explanation! I've since corrected the redirect to the correct explanation and expanded the term for our UK visitors. See [[Brown goods]]. --[[User:Quatermass|Quatermass]] ([[User talk:Quatermass|talk]]) 09:51, 13 October 2010 (UTC)

Should it be mentioned that nowadays some products (such as cameras, microphones and GPS) have become less common because they are integrated in smartphones?

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

{{closed|text=
After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==

I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki].

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

{{closed|text=
After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Electron tube]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

== ever falling prices? ==
{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==
{{closed|text=
After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Electron tube]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section.

Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

== ever falling prices? ==
{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Electron tube]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

I am thinking about the advice [[Wikipedia:Article_size#Breaking_out_an_unwanted_section|contained here]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 17:29, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==

I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

{{closed|text=
After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Electron tube]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

::A look at each item in both lists reveals a few date discrepancies discrepancy, invention of the triode and invention of the iconoscope, but otherwise both lists are completely different.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

::Would it be more appropriate to '''split''' this into [[Timeline of consumer electronics]]?

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:Yes, that was an error on my part. I really thought that the collaboration would be an exception to that rule, but the reality was it not.

::::That is a good point, without sources a new article would be deleted rather quickly. With that in mind, I am at a loss with what to do with this content, fact checking each item would be very time consuming.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

::A look at each item in both lists reveals a few date discrepancies discrepancy, invention of the triode and invention of the iconoscope, but otherwise both lists are completely different.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed?

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

::A look at each item in both lists reveals a few date discrepancies discrepancy, invention of the triode and invention of the iconoscope, but otherwise both lists are completely different. If it wasn't the case that one was a table and the other in text form it would be an easy merge. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 05:24, 14 September 2014 (UTC)

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:Yes, that was an error on my part. I really thought that the collaboration would be an exception to that rule, but the reality was it not.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== ever falling prices? ==
{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good. I might check it for things we may have overlooked, but in that case I'd rather dig out a proper source than go through the process of translating unsourced material.

== Internal links ==
{{closed|text=
After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Electron tube]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== ever falling prices? ==
{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki].

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:Yes, that was an error on my part. I really thought that the collaboration would be an exception to that rule, but the reality was it not.

::::That is a good point, without sources a new article would be deleted rather quickly.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}}

:* iPod  &quot;

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:

Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged.

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years.

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== ever falling prices? ==
{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with  Electronics industry==
{{closed|text=
I think this a article should be merged with [[Electronics industry]], but I am unsure which direction the merge should go. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:02, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki]. Remember that per [[Wikipedia:Translation]] we have to tag the talk page with {{tl|Translated page}} so as to preserve copyright. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:44, 9 September 2014 (UTC)
:I'm a Finnish translator but I don't find the Finnish page particularly good.

== Internal links ==
{{closed|text=
After going through the links in this article looking for the disambiguation pages mentioned in the tag at the top, the only ones I found are:
*&lt;s&gt;[[High vacuum]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Electron tube]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[KDKA]]&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;[[Arthur Berry]]&lt;/s&gt;
Don't have time to look at them at the moment so will leave them here and will hopefully get back to them.

I also noticed several pages linked to multiple times, most often from within the history section, as far as I am aware this is incorrect and only the first instance should be tagged. Also, there appears to be a higher than normal number of redirect pages linked. [[User:CSJJ104|CSJJ104]] ([[User talk:CSJJ104|talk]]) 09:38, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest.

::::That is a good point, without sources a new article would be deleted rather quickly.

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== ever falling prices? ==
{{closed|text=
i don't think, that the prices are &quot;ever falling&quot; there are many CE sectors, where the pricing is quite constant since many years. The number of transistors is you can get for a given price is rising and you get more perforamnce and features for the same price. --[[User:MrBurns|MrBurns]] ([[User talk:MrBurns|talk]]) 22:59, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;. That two stubb/start class articles on related topics happen to have almost identical contents reflects the poor initial quality of these articles, not the ultimate scope corresponding to title that we should be aiming at.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}} 
:Instead of {{quote|&quot;Important devices for some reson:}} 
:* Walkman 
:* iPod  &quot;
:As for linking to lists, a simple link to [[:Category:Consumer electronics]] will do. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation efforts ==

Melody Lavender has started translating from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterhaltungselektronik the German page] on consumer electronics, but there is also good content that can be grabbed from [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot%C5%99ebn%C3%AD_elektronika Czech wiki], [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electr%C3%B3nica_de_consumo Spanish wiki] and [https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viihde-elektroniikka Finnish wiki].

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

:'''Comment:''' Looking purely at the semantics and [[Wikipedia:Scope|scope]] of it, they are different things; electronic industry manufactures electronics that are meant for others than consumers, too. I think the [[Electronics industry]] article is just currently out of scope and tries to back this up with the unsupported claim &quot;electronics industry, especially meaning consumer electronics&quot;.

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end.

According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...

== Lists of consumer electronics? ==

How should we represent individual products or classes of products in this article? FOr examples, we could talk egenrally about personal audio devices, but the importance of the [[Walkman]] and [[iPod]] probably also warrant a mention. It would be easy to include a list of notable consumer electronics, but it might be easier to include a generic writeup and forward people to the relevant category, or a preexisting list article. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 15:15, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:Individual products can be used as examples to illustrate [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. Any lists would be either severely incomplete or overly exhaustive. I can't see a list of 'notable' consumer electronics being anything but irrelevant; if some item is important then it should be included in prose and with context. Eg. {{quote|&quot;Walkman popularized the idea of a portable audio player, while the iPod connected online music retail with portable devices&quot;}}

== Merge timeline ==

The timeline part of the History section in this article seems like it does, or will eventually be duplicated with the [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] and I am proposing that we condense the timeline content in this article, put a {{tl|main}} tag on it, and merge it into the slightly broader [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 04:00, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''': Condensing it should also mean putting it in [[WP:PROSE|prose]]. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 17:04, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: '''Support''' but I have some doubts about the qualtiy of the machine translation. The terminology needs to be checked line by line and then it all needs to be put into prose.--[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 19:25, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

: &lt;s&gt;Support&lt;/s&gt;. I don't have a problem with the use of a condensed list format in the timeline for this article, as they're easy to read and obtain a general summary from. However, I also don't oppose a conversion to prose formatting, if anyone wants to perform this. A merge to Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering is fine for the bulk of the content. It will definitely take some time and significant work to reformat content to fit the table at the merge target, though.  [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:11, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Support''' agreed, per above. [[User:EuroCarGT|&lt;span style=&quot;color:cyan&quot;&gt;'''///Euro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;'''Car'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:EuroCarGT|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''GT'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 02:43, 12 September 2014 (UTC)
::A look at each item in both lists reveals a few date discrepancies discrepancy, invention of the triode and invention of the iconoscope, but otherwise both lists are completely different. If it wasn't the case that one was a table and the other in text form it would be an easy merge. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 05:24, 14 September 2014 (UTC)

{{Outdent|2}} '''Alternative to merge.''' We should move the material to [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering|the talkpage]] over at [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] instead of merging. There are three rationales for this: 1) The material is unsourced and therefor better as reference material to help editors determine how to expand that article. 2) As [[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] said, the source and target articles use different forms and as such a merger would take considerable effort. 3) There is a comment from February 2014 at the talkpage of [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] suggesting that that article is already out of scope and should be split; adding more material now would be unhelpful to that end. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 19:07, 14 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' I am afraid the two lists don't exactly overlap each other and merging may cause loss of some information. I prefer to leave them as they are. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 19:45, 14 September 2014 (UTC)
::Would it be more appropriate to '''split''' this into [[Timeline of consumer electronics]]? I feel like the timeline it taking up 80% of the article, and detracting from the overall coverage of the subject. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 01:24, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
::*'''Support split'''. This would work out better, and would become a valid, workable [[WP:SPINOUT]] of this article. Struck the &quot;Support&quot; in my comment above. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:38, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:::'''Support''' splitting as what NickPenguin stated. The history section is a bit long and moving it to a separate article is ideal. [[User:EuroCarGT|&lt;span style=&quot;color:cyan&quot;&gt;'''///Euro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;'''Car'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:EuroCarGT|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''GT'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 20:41, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
According to [[Wikipedia:Translation]] Google &quot;translations&quot; aka Google garble are worse than nothing. So I've commented out the machine translated part of the second section. The Google garble in the first section has been edited many times, but still, it absolutely has to be reviewed by someone who speaks German. It's a technical text. Another alternative would be to keep only the most obvious and important points and simply delete the rest. Also, I will not be able to revise the whole thing in the near future. --[[User:Melody Lavender|Melody Lavender]] ([[User talk:Melody Lavender|talk]]) 05:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:Yes, that was an error on my part. I really thought that the collaboration would be an exception to that rule, but the reality was it not. In hindsight it should have been translated bit by bit, so I apologize for that. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 13:57, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

:::'''Support split'''. But please make sure it has some sources so that it doesn't have to be nominated for deletion straight away. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 15:12, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
::::That is a good point, without sources a new article would be deleted rather quickly. With that in mind, I am at a loss with what to do with this content, fact checking each item would be very time consuming. I am actually surprised it is permitted on DeWiki, they are usually very strict about content. I would hate to remove potentially good content, but perhaps it is better gone? I am thinking about the advice [[Wikipedia:Article_size#Breaking_out_an_unwanted_section|contained here]]. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 17:29, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:::::Rather than deleting, it could be moved to an article talk page (my original &quot;alternative to merge&quot;), [[Wikipedia:Userfication|userified]] or moved to [[Wikipedia:Drafts|draft]] namespace. The advantage of all these namespaces (talk, user, draft) other than article is that they don't have notability and source requirements. [[User:Finnusertop|Finnusertop]] ([[User_talk:Finnusertop|talk]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/guestbook|guestbook]] &amp;#124; [[User:Finnusertop/contributions|contribs]]) 22:29, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
::::::In my experience, those are sometimes, but not always, soft deletions. However in this case, they would probably be preferable. I think the talk page or draft would be the best solution, userfying would likely cause the content to get lost. --[[User:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen;&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;Penguin&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;'''contribs'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sub&gt; 23:09, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:::::Much of the article, and almost all the timeline, is generally about the history of electronics rather than specifically that of consumer goods. We have other articles on electronics, which are the right places for such matters. [[User:Jim.henderson|Jim.henderson]] ([[User talk:Jim.henderson|talk]]) 11:44, 20 September 2014 (UTC)

:::'''Support split''' - Dumping all this into [[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]] is not going to improve that article. Leaving it here constitutes an [[WP:UNDUE]] issue. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 14:49, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

::So, I moved it, and indeed it made that bad article even worse, while making this dreadful (and to my mind more important) one less bad.  Questions of improving the other so it will be be only as bad as I found it, or beyond, can continue at [[Talk:Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]].  [[User:Jim.henderson|Jim.henderson]] ([[User talk:Jim.henderson|talk]]) 21:23, 28 September 2014 (UTC)

==Start of history==
[[Consumer_electronics#History]] seems to claim that consumer electronics started with the transistor. [[Electronics industry]] (and our new lead from there) claims that the [[Receiver (radio)]] was the first consumer electronics product. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6483/Consumer-Electronics.html This] seems to support that contention. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 15:13, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

== History of consumption ==

The History section seems focused on the production of the electronic in devices, and does not seems to include much background on how consumers purchased, and how producers commercialised to them. Also the introduction seems rather dense, and does seem to speak a lot about markets and historical timelines. It seems reasonable to move this down, and widen History to cover wider aspects of consuming media, information and entertainment via electronic devices. If you agree, would you suggest starting with the History or the Introduction, and how should either be developed? [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 14:54, 28 January 2021 (UTC)

== In this context, &quot;consumer&quot; is meaningless ==

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. &quot;Consumer&quot; means &quot;one who consumes&quot;{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is &quot;it's something that people use&quot;{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted. I have been trying my best to fix this but it's embedded too deep. See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place. Personally, I prefer &quot;individual&quot;, but I can understand why corporations wouldn't want us to be using a word like that...
