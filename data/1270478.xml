I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.  I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite wear i have done most of my work building larg damns and building and mantaining haould roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250tun trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use witch is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do privet work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wall marts, loes, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.  I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite wear i have done most of my work building larg damns and building and mantaining haould roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250tun trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use witch is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do privet work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wall marts, loes, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or outehr parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so i would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This is the company i work for [http://www.hooverconstruction.biz, Hoover Construcion Co.]

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.  I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results.

unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this.

==heavy construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.

Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true.

Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.

Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

==heavy construction==

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

Any thoughts on the History of Construction? eg Primitive Shelters -Megaliths of Europe - Egypt, Greece, Rome etc

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true.

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

==heavy construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.  I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

==Heavy/Highway vs Highway/Heavy==
Well I'm on here I ponder if there is any significances in the ordering of these words, all of the literature I have looked at in the office has it highway heavy, is this a company to company thing or region to region, or insignificant?[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 02:11, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

Any thoughts on the History of Construction? eg Primitive Shelters -Megaliths of Europe - Egypt, Greece, Rome etc

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to 2-3 only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? {{unsigned|86.43.79.87}}

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap. (It also looks like it was written by someone infected with credentialitis in a really bad way.)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole thing does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in plain English. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to 2-3 only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

==heavy construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them...

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.

Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

==heavy construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in MN, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)  This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction.

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men.

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the U.S. term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical U.S. estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

Alistair Twiname

:Yes, there is a definite bias to this article- but I don't think it is specifically North American. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section is applicable to much of Canada as well, but on larger construction projects it is usually the role of architects and engineers to review the work and to issue some form of certificate at completion. The &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; (in most cases the municipal building authority) will issue an occupancy permit based on this. Also the bit about &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; is not the norm here or with what I've seen in the US for that matter- in fact the opposite is true. So-called &quot;design build&quot; firms are usually either larger construction companies (sometimes architectural firms) that engage the services of separate architects and engineers directly OR very small outfits that work primarily in small-scale residential (additions, single-family) or commercial renovations- work that most often does not require professional services.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the U.S. term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical U.S. estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd yea in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of MN.  This is all privet work and it’s on the scale of 2 to 20 million dollar highway projects.  The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.  Also we do private work for the CN railroad as well as the rail systems used by the mines.

Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the U.S. term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical U.S. estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do.

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building roads, bridges, damns, and the like are also construction.  I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in Nevada, and coal mines out east.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men.

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results.

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

:::Are mines part of the construction industry?  Please provide examples of large projects done in heavy/highway completed for private corporations.  Thanks.  [[User:Stevenwmccrary58|Steven McCrary]] 02:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men.

Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them...

==North American bias==

I am a British Architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term 
unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the crane is said to be  &quot;getting ready &quot;etc.  Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans

Jack Hill

I also note the heavy US bias of this article, the &quot;Authority having jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant in this article
Alistair Twiname



==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== This Article Omits ===
This article amits any mention of the academic education programs that lead to either [[associate's degree]]s or [[bachelor's degree]]s in the fields that are called [[Building Construction]], [[Building Technology]], or [[Building Science]], and as you can see, there are not '''any''' articles on these subjects already. None of these phrases is even mentioned in this article, yet people who have earned these degrees work on the same projects, and on the same work teams as [[civil engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, [[mechanical engineer]]s, [[electrical engineer]]s, [[structural engineer]]s, and so forth.     &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.67.166.55|98.67.166.55]] ([[User talk:98.67.166.55|talk]]) 01:25, 12 April 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap. (It also looks like it was written by someone infected with credentialitis in a really bad way.) Go ahead and nuke it. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:serif;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Argyriou|Αργυριου]]''' [[User talk:Argyriou|(talk)]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:04, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

Here in the United States the employment market for construction executives is very slow. 2010 will be a worse time for employment than 2009 according to the hundreds of clients we have in construction.

==Repeating Paragraphs==
{{tlc|editsemiprotected}}
Two paragraphs under the Types of Construction heading are repeated further down the section.

I suggest removing the second instance of the repeated paragraphs.--[[User:Chapm.simon|SimonC]] ([[User talk:Chapm.simon|talk]]) 05:49, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them...

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::I agree strongly that inanimate objects and machines such as cranes, [[bulldozer]]s, I-beams, and so forth must not be acribed with human or animate characteristics.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men.

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article.

The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap. (It also looks like it was written by someone infected with credentialitis in a really bad way.) Go ahead and nuke it. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:serif;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Argyriou|Αργυριου]]''' [[User talk:Argyriou|(talk)]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:04, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do.

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap. (It also looks like it was written by someone infected with credentialitis in a really bad way.) Go ahead and nuke it. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:serif;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Argyriou|Αργυριου]]''' [[User talk:Argyriou|(talk)]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:04, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do.

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::I agree strongly that inanimate objects and machines such as cranes, [[bulldozer]]s, I-beams, and so forth must not be acribed with human or animate characteristics.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

==Best construction shapes in construction==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built).

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

:::Are mines part of the construction industry?  Please provide examples of large projects done in heavy/highway completed for private corporations.  Thanks.  [[User:Stevenwmccrary58|Steven McCrary]] 02:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

==Heavy/Highway vs Highway/Heavy==
Well I'm on here I ponder if there is any significances in the ordering of these words, all of the literature I have looked at in the office has it highway heavy, is this a company to company thing or region to region, or insignificant?[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 02:11, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

Any thoughts on the History of Construction? eg Primitive Shelters -Megaliths of Europe - Egypt, Greece, Rome etc

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap. (It also looks like it was written by someone infected with credentialitis in a really bad way.) Go ahead and nuke it. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:serif;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Argyriou|Αργυριου]]''' [[User talk:Argyriou|(talk)]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:04, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Repeating Paragraphs==
{{tlc|editsemiprotected}}
Two paragraphs under the Types of Construction heading are repeated further down the section.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built).

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term.

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio
:Yes, it seems to focus too much on business/legal side of things, ignoring the technical side. [[User:Samohyl Jan|Samohyl Jan]] 15:40, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
::I added some to the Highway/heavy section, my personal experience puts close to 1/3 of these projects, if not more, being private work, generally for large corporations, mines, factories and the like. [[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 15:32, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
:::Are mines part of the construction industry?  Please provide examples of large projects done in heavy/highway completed for private corporations.  Thanks.  [[User:Stevenwmccrary58|Steven McCrary]] 02:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap. (It also looks like it was written by someone infected with credentialitis in a really bad way.) Go ahead and nuke it. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:serif;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Argyriou|Αργυριου]]''' [[User talk:Argyriou|(talk)]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:04, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

== Construction industry qualifications ==

The section about &quot;construction industry qualifications&quot; makes little to no sense.  &quot;Sandwich Study&quot;?  I propose deleting this section. [[User:Drnathanfurious|Drnathanfurious]] 16:55, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap.

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::I added some to the Highway/heavy section, my personal experience puts close to 1/3 of these projects, if not more, being private work, generally for large corporations, mines, factories and the like. [[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 15:32, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
:::Are mines part of the construction industry?  Please provide examples of large projects done in heavy/highway completed for private corporations.  Thanks.  [[User:Stevenwmccrary58|Steven McCrary]] 02:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap.

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

:There's probably a place to talk about training programs, including craft/trade apprenticeships and more technical training prgrams for superintendents and construction engineers, but the section as written is crap.

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; I'm not saying this information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them.

We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge.

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

:I also note the heavy Americn bias of this article, and the &quot;Authority Having Jurisdiction&quot; section seems particularly irrelevant to this article.

::I agree strongly that inanimate objects and machines such as cranes, [[bulldozer]]s, I-beams, and so forth must not be acribed with human or animate characteristics.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::I agree strongly that inanimate objects and machines such as cranes, [[bulldozer]]s, I-beams, and so forth must not be acribed with human or animate characteristics.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio
:Yes, it seems to focus too much on business/legal side of things, ignoring the technical side. [[User:Samohyl Jan|Samohyl Jan]] 15:40, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
::I added some to the Highway/heavy section, my personal experience puts close to 1/3 of these projects, if not more, being private work, generally for large corporations, mines, factories and the like. [[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 15:32, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
:::Are mines part of the construction industry?  Please provide examples of large projects done in heavy/highway completed for private corporations.  Thanks.  [[User:Stevenwmccrary58|Steven McCrary]] 02:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

==Heavy/Highway vs Highway/Heavy==

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them...

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas.

More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio
:Yes, it seems to focus too much on business/legal side of things, ignoring the technical side. [[User:Samohyl Jan|Samohyl Jan]] 15:40, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
::I added some to the Highway/heavy section, my personal experience puts close to 1/3 of these projects, if not more, being private work, generally for large corporations, mines, factories and the like. [[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 15:32, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
:::Are mines part of the construction industry?  Please provide examples of large projects done in heavy/highway completed for private corporations.  Thanks.  [[User:Stevenwmccrary58|Steven McCrary]] 02:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.  That is certainly heavy construction; thanks for the clarification.  I have added the content to the main page; please check it to see if it represents that segment of the industry.

==Heavy/Highway vs Highway/Heavy==

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

[[User:Aquilina|Aquilina]] 17:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects.

Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men.

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them...

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::I agree strongly that inanimate objects and machines such as cranes, [[bulldozer]]s, I-beams, and so forth must not be acribed with human or animate characteristics.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

::I agree strongly that inanimate objects and machines such as cranes, [[bulldozer]]s, I-beams, and so forth must not be acribed with human or animate characteristics.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

:::Are mines part of the construction industry?  Please provide examples of large projects done in heavy/highway completed for private corporations.  Thanks.  [[User:Stevenwmccrary58|Steven McCrary]] 02:09, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Zath42, thanks.  So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)</text>

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...</text>

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ?

Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.

*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built).

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==North American bias==

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Construction = word for result or only for process? ==

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== (Bias, Seemingly animate Cranes) ==
 
=====North American bias=====
&lt;small&gt;The section heading &quot;North American bias&quot; is preserved as a heading in order to preserve its &lt;!-- spell check: addressable--&gt; addressability, but was no more chosen by the contributor whose comment it summarizes than was the larger, parenthesized heading just above it. (In contrast, parentheses may alert readers that a heading is retro-fitted to summarize a section whose originally failed summarize the topic via a TOC entry -- breaks links to the previous &quot;bare&quot; address.) &lt;/small&gt;

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.&lt;br&gt;

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.&lt;br&gt;[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

I come here from te german Wikipedia and wanted to link [[de:Bauwerk]] somewhere. This is the word not only for a [[Building]] ([[de:Gebäude]]), but for every kind of construction made by men. So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 14:14, 8 February 2006&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; 

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

=====North American bias=====
&lt;small&gt;The section heading &quot;North American bias&quot; is preserved as a heading in order to preserve its &lt;!-- spell check: addressable--&gt; addressability, but was no more chosen by the contributor whose comment it summarizes than was the larger, parenthesized heading just above it. (In contrast, parentheses may alert readers that a heading is retro-fitted to summarize a section whose originally failed summarize the topic via a TOC entry -- breaks links to the previous &quot;bare&quot; address.) &lt;/small&gt;

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.&lt;br&gt;

I detest complainers who are not willing to actually do something about their situation. Wikipedia is a worlwide collaborative encyclopedia of information. I happen to live in the US, and while I know about major construction projects that are reported in other parts of the world, I am no expert on them. If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.&lt;br&gt;[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term.

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do.

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work.

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== (Bias, Seemingly animate Cranes) ==
 
=====North American bias=====
&lt;small&gt;The section heading &quot;North American bias&quot; is preserved as a heading in order to preserve its &lt;!-- spell check: addressable--&gt; addressability, but was no more chosen by the contributor whose comment it summarizes than was the larger, parenthesized heading just above it. (In contrast, parentheses may alert readers that a heading is retro-fitted to summarize a section whose originally failed summarize the topic via a TOC entry -- breaks links to the previous &quot;bare&quot; address.) &lt;/small&gt;

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article. Be that as it may I refer to the caption of the mustachioed worker who is dealing with GORM-Wire  That is a  term unknown to me and, I imagine, many others. The spiral looks to me like reinforcing rod for a concrete column, but it would help to have an explanation.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.&lt;br&gt;

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.

*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction

*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work.

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

=====North American bias=====
&lt;small&gt;The section heading &quot;North American bias&quot; is preserved as a heading in order to preserve its &lt;!-- spell check: addressable--&gt; addressability, but was no more chosen by the contributor whose comment it summarizes than was the larger, parenthesized heading just above it. (In contrast, parentheses may alert readers that a heading is retro-fitted to summarize a section whose originally failed summarize the topic via a TOC entry -- breaks links to the previous &quot;bare&quot; address.) &lt;/small&gt;

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article.

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state.

These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004.

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So my question is: why is this articel only related to the process, not to the result? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.43.79.87|86.43.79.87]] ([[User talk:86.43.79.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.43.79.87|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 14:14, 8 February 2006&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; 

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

== AHJ / NVQ / SVQ ==

Is &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; a term specific to the United States? Also isn't NVQ specific to England and SVQ to Scotland? [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 19:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Im not sure about the construction code, but in the National Electrical Code the Authority Having Jurisdiction(AHJ) can be an inspector, a single person, not just an agency.  Wouldn't this be the same for construction?

--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)AHJ is unquestionably a United States term that refers broadly to a Building Official (inspector, fire marshal etc.) and the local, state or federal authority l that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the building code that is in effect at a given location--[[User:Wikihelpercfc|cfcx23]] ([[User talk:Wikihelpercfc|talk]]) 22:03, 22 January 2012 (UTC)

==Jargon==
I've rescued the building construction paragraph which had been vandalised and left for a month or so. The whole article does reek of jargon though. It needs rewriting in '''Plain English'''. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 23:27, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

==Images==

A bit heavy on the buildings and skyscrapers only. Where are the bridges, tunnels, dams? Suggest broadening the scope of the images, and reducing buidling images to two or three only to make space. [[User:MadMaxDog|MadMaxDog]] 12:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Third Sentence ==

I believe there should be an &quot;and&quot; in the third sentence between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;supervised&quot; instead of a comma.

== Red and White construction site poles ==
Query - What is the purpose of those red and white pole &quot;archways/tunnel&quot; that are littered around a large building site, especially I've noticed on highway construction sites. They have wires with little red and white triangles hanging on them between two coloured poles, and look like lorries and equipment get driven under/through them... What are they and why are they there?? Thanks

==Best construction shapes==
Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ? Appearantly, bees have chosen the hexagon since it requires less material than making ie the combs from triangles. Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work.

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

===Construction phases===
 
&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise 
 
* Proposed – a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government 
 
* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life
 
* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state 
 
* Renovation – modification to the building. This can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years
 
* Demolition – destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere.

=====North American bias=====
&lt;small&gt;The section heading &quot;North American bias&quot; is preserved as a heading in order to preserve its &lt;!-- spell check: addressable--&gt; addressability, but was no more chosen by the contributor whose comment it summarizes than was the larger, parenthesized heading just above it. (In contrast, parentheses may alert readers that a heading is retro-fitted to summarize a section whose originally failed summarize the topic via a TOC entry -- breaks links to the previous &quot;bare&quot; address.) &lt;/small&gt;

I am a British architect and note the strong North American bias of this article.

I note too that the [[crane]] is said to be &quot;getting ready&quot;, etc. Cranes are inanimate but can be readied for operation by humans.&lt;br&gt;

If you have knowledge and can cite sources of information about construction in places other than North America (or the US), that's what Wikipedia is here for and you have been requested to do. Rather than complain about it, add your content, please. You will be helping everyone expand their knowledge. If you don't like the wording or human attributes ascribed to inanimate objects, change it! The White House will not comment on it.

==Heavy Construction==

I work in highway/heavy construction and this article seams to be missing much of what we do.  Building [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, and the like are also construction. I'm going to make some minor relevant changes now, and when I have time expand a larger section to highway/heavy.&lt;br&gt;[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 09:47, 14 July 2005 (UTC)Mack builders columbus ohio

::::I work for a highway/heavy contractor, a substantial portion of the work we do is contracted for the mines, in the early years we did the mass grading, and site work for the haul roads and site locations of the Largest Iron Ore Mine in the U.S., and we built and do the maintenance on multiple tailings basins.  We get large projects to move anything from 100,00CYLV to 3,000,000CYLV on most if the mines, this year marked the 3rd [[year]] in a row that we worked on every iron ore mine in the state of [[Minnesota]]. This is all private work and it is on the scale of two to 20 million dollar highway projects. The mines themselves do lots of heavy construction, and we are not the only contractor that works with the mines.  They most often hold competitive bids much like a state. Clevland Clifs is one of the major owners in a many of these mines, paticularly Hibbing Taconite where I have done most of my work building large dams and building and mantaining haul roads.  These haul roads are built and designed for 250ton trucks.  Often the mines do this work themselves and it varies form mine to mine, I only know for sure at the iron ore mines, but the equipment they use which is the same as what many contractors use is used at large gold mines in [[Nevada]], and coal mines out east. Also we do private work for the [[Canadian National Railroad]] as well as the rail systems used by the mines.  Also we do large site work projects the mass grading for large factories, much like that found at the mines, for shopping malls, wal marts, loews, united health, olive garden, the list goes own, and this is work in Minnesota, we have 10 to 15 main competitors in the area, as well as many from out of the area.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC) This might not be true of outher countrys or other parts of the world, but we have worked in colorado, canada, michigan, wisconsin, and alaska, so I would say so in the us.[[User:Zath42|Zath42]] 00:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

So, as I understand it, your company is not doing the actual mining but assisting the mine with its operations, such as building its rail lines, access roads, building dams, and doing general &quot;site&quot; work.

:I don't know anything about the German language, but I believe that this article only discusses the process of construction because there are innumerable results. Construction can produce anything because it is such a general term. A user will search for the specific result of construction, most likely, if he or she wants to know about that particular result, or he or she can click on any of the links under the [[Construction#Construction_trades|construction trades section]] to see the results for that particular type of construction. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 21:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Bauwerk&quot; refers to the finished building. &quot;Baugewerbe&quot; or &quot;Bauen&quot; or &quot;Häuslebauen&quot; would be closer. &quot;Bauwerk&quot; or &quot;Gebäude&quot; could be linked to [[building]].--[[User:Ahering@cogeco.ca|Achim]] 00:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup==

I've cleaned up the external links section, as it was becoming akin to a mini web directory of anything vaguely construction-related.  Link should generally go on the most specific relevant page - e.g. Carpentry tips on [[Carpentry]] etc.

Furthermore, most of this article is unstrucured, information-less lists - this sort of list is exactly what categories are for! There is no need to write out the contents of [[:Category:Construction]] to fill an article.  This should be converted to prose, or deleted.

&gt;I am with the American Society of Professional Estimators and I have a short comment regarding jargon omitted from the site.  I believe there should be definitions and terms common to all countries included if possible. I see under &quot;Design Team&quot;, that cost professional titles like &quot;cost engineer&quot; and &quot;quantity surveyor&quot; are included, but not the American term &quot;estimator&quot; or “cost estimator”.  The typical American estimator must understand and contribute both a quantity survey and pricing, which not all quantity surveys do. We feel it is an important distinction and should be included in the construction design team paragraph.

Wouldn't a section or a new article regarding &quot;the best construction shapes&quot; be useful ?

Thus, it is still a very good construction shape ie when building storage cells (ie for food, ...) Decagons are the best shape for construction as an alternative to the circle (which can't be built). Finally, the rectangle shape with a crossed beam (similar to the structure of Euplectella aspergillum ) is especially strong . See [[User:Tylerlorenzi/Hierarchical_Structure_of_Glass_Sponges]]

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Removed content==
I have removed the below bullet list - should be converted to prose and add sources if reintroduced.

===Construction phases===
 
&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise 
 
* Proposed – a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government 
 
* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Construction&amp;oldid=662164900 this old version] to see it before my edits. - [[User:PennySpender1983|¢Spender1983]] ([[User talk:PennySpender1983|talk]]) 04:02, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Construction (as defined here) is such a broad subject that it should be a category as well as an article.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Edward27821|Edward27821]] ([[User talk:Edward27821|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Edward27821|contribs]]) 05:43, 29 May 2016 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Removed content==
I have removed the below bullet list - should be converted to prose and add sources if reintroduced.

===Construction phases===
 
&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise 
 
* Proposed – a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government 
 
* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life
 
* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state 
 
* Renovation – modification to the building. This can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years
 
* Demolition – destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere.

If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around!

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work.

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Removed content==
I have removed the below bullet list - should be converted to prose and add sources if reintroduced.

===Construction phases===
 
&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise 
 
* Proposed – a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government 
 
* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life
 
* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state 
 
* Renovation – modification to the building. This can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years
 
* Demolition – destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere.

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

===Construction phases===
 
&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise 
 
* Proposed – a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government 
 
* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life
 
* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state 
 
* Renovation – modification to the building. This can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years
 
* Demolition – destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere.

==Modern professional bias==

The lead and the whole article is written like the only construction that exists is that which builds highways and city blocks in modern times, and is only caried out by huge managed, skilled, professional work force. It also has more emphasis on the staff management and building permits involed and slightly money involved in this career rather than on the &quot;construction&quot; itself. Also many times it has a sentence with a long list of unlinked job words in the middle that feel awkward, like &quot;In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies&quot; 

I'm not saying any information is incorrect, or shouldn't be here, but I think some info is repeated and could be trimmed, especially of [[weasel words]] and it could be sub section or at least in a more fleshed out article with better coverage of other areas. Has a tiny history section at the end, usually history should be near the top, shouldn't it? Article needs a lot more history from perhaps Stone, Bronze, Iron Age, through Stonehenge, the Pyramids through Medieval, Industrial to modern maybe near future. More on building materials and finding them and getting them there. More on methods of sticking things together like, cement, timber joints, bolts, welds? More on what does the work, man power, animals, use of machines like pulleys, wheels, cranes, diggers. More about foundations. More about why/what we build, homes, storage, infrastructure, military, protection, buisiness, to look pretty. Also even if most of the article is about modern professional builds, some mention of ancient construction, military construction, illegal construction, what happens if built without permission of everyone you need, bad construction, when construction is not sound and falls down, small individual novice DIY type construction. I constructed a garden wall and patio my self I'm sure I could stretch to a brick shed without needing a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.

It has slight point of views issues, with [[weasel words]] about what makes a good construction team, kind of sounds like a job interview, such as &quot;far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking.&quot; twice, and &quot;For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential&quot; and &quot;In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality&quot;. and &quot;Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use&quot;.

&quot;Kent Hansen (not linked, no description) pointed out that state departments of transportation (DOTs) usually use design build contracts as a way of getting projects done when states don't have the resources&quot; that's nice who is Kent Hansen though.

There are only 7 sources on the whole article and many broad unsourced dubious statements.

Construction is one of Wikipedias vital 100 articles, I think it needs some care.

== Construction ==

I recently noticed that the people who manage the article Architecture presume it is only about civil architecture, not about all aspects of architecture. This article is the same, it presumes construction is building construction and ignores big construction topics which show up in [[:Category:Construction]] such as ship, road, and coastal construction and smaller topics within building construction like demolition, restoration/preservation, home building, etc. Should I take the meanings of words literally? If so the article construction should be an overview of all aspects of the word. That is a lot to wrap one's mind around! [[User:Jim Derby|Jim Derby]] ([[User talk:Jim Derby|talk]]) 22:40, 29 December 2013 (UTC)

For example I found a list of construction injuries grouped by &quot;subindustry&quot; from the early 20th century U.S. Some of the terminology has changed but my point is that ''construction'' covers a lot more than building construction.
*Wrecking, moving and razing of buildings
*Excavating and foundation work, dredging, ditch-digging
*Grading, highway work, clearing land and reclamation work
*Railroad construction
*Tunneling and subway construction
*Sewers, cesspools, laying of pipes, etc
*Canal construction
*Well-drilling—water (oil drilling under oil industry)
*Fence construction
*Dam and levee construction, piers, drydocks—pile driving
*Boat building of wood—small and large
*Ship building and repairing—steel and iron
*Marine wrecking and salvaging
*Building construction, carpentry, masonry, concrete, brick, steel erecting and iron work on exterior of buildings
*Elevator erection and installation, both freight and passenger 5
*Plumbing and gas fitting
*General electric equipment and installation
*Marble and stone work—erection and setting stone
*Paper-hanging, painting, plastering and decorating, both interior and exterior
*Paving—all sidewalk and street work, asphalt and concrete
*Roofing, tinsmithing, sheet metal contracting, etc.
*Bill-posting and sign painting
*Surveying and inspection work
*Miscellaneous—not otherwise classified

:* Many of the issues you state (and are also stated in above sections) are a result of a poor merging of [[building construction]] into this article back in 2004. I'm going to try to take some stuff out. Building construction can probably be its own article if someone want to do the work.

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise

* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance.

* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life
 
* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state 
 
* Renovation – modification to the building. This can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years
 
* Demolition – destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere.

* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.

== Article improvement ==

I have spent a few sessions trying to update this article, to make it broadly applicable to the whole field of construction (some sections were/are heavily focused on US- or UK-centric content), to explain the industry's complexity, and to indicate the scale and importance of the sector to the world economy. This is still very much work-in-progress and it would be good to get more inputs on areas which are currently only sketchily explained, and - across most sections - to add and improve references.

== Is it necessary to explain the difference Construction vs. Manufacturing? ==

The opening paragraph finds it necessary to explain the difference between Construction and Manufacturing.  Is there anyone else who finds this mostly unnecessary?  Note that the Manufacturing article doesn't see a need to explain the difference in the opposite direction.

Even if we would keep the difference there, I don't think the way the difference is defined is very good.  Manufacturing is not necessarily done for mass production with an unknown purchaser, e.g. airplanes, industrial equipment, railcars are all typically made on order and only once.  The key difference I think is that construction involves creating something that can not be moved afterwards.  But adding that definition would be Original Research so I don't dare touch the article...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.71.13.2|92.71.13.2]] ([[User talk:92.71.13.2|talk]]) 15:56, 26 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Removed content==

===Construction phases===
 
&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise 
 
* Proposed – a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government 
 
* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life

===Construction phases===
 
&lt;!-- these terms are used throughout Wikipedia building articles, but not explained anywhere--&gt;
 
* Vision/fantasy/idea – a concept never intended to be built, may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise 
 
* Proposed – a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government 
 
* Approved – a building concept that will be constructed in the near future. If the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted, or it may be deferred or cancelled.
 
* Design – the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor
 
* Procurement – the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction. This may be by competitive tendering. 
 
* Diversions – before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building. This can include drainage, water and gas piped services and power and communication cables.  
 
* Under-construction – a fully designed building currently being built
 
* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life
 
* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state 
 
* Renovation – modification to the building. This can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years
 
* Demolition – destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere.

* Ground works – construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations
 
* Topped-out – a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building
 
* [[Fitting out]] – installation of the decorative, non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete. This includes painting, ceilings, light fittings etc.
 
* [[New-construction building commissioning|Commissioning]] or setting to work – Once the  building [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|Mechanical, electrical, plumbing]], communications, and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performance. In modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots, spurious alarms, higher energy bills, and systems failing during emergencies 
 
* Substantial Completion / Beneficial Occupancy – a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the Owner can occupy (Items noted during inspection 'punch list' or 'snag list' may still be corrected)
 
* Complete/built – a fully designed building that has been fully built, excluding future expansions (punch list items all completed)
 
* Building Operation – All those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used. In simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff. If they do their job right then you hardly notice them.
 
* Maintenance – works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design, including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life
 
* Repair – replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state 
 
* Renovation – modification to the building. This can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years
 
* Demolition – destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere.

== Article improvement ==

I have spent a few sessions trying to update this article, to make it broadly applicable to the whole field of construction (some sections were/are heavily focused on US- or UK-centric content), to explain the industry's complexity, and to indicate the scale and importance of the sector to the world economy. This is still very much work-in-progress and it would be good to get more inputs on areas which are currently only sketchily explained, and - across most sections - to add and improve references. [[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 15:47, 5 May 2020 (UTC)

Done a bit more today. Updated the barchart using 2018 UN construction GVA data, and tidied up the careers section.[[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 14:27, 26 June 2020 (UTC)

== Addition of builder ==

The addition of builder would be worth a thought under higher education. As in some countries  Builder is no longer considered a tried. In Australia a builder now has two more years experience than a tradesperson and normally a certificate four or diploma in construction. Looks forward to your reply [[User:Sntmichael|Sntmichael]] ([[User talk:Sntmichael|talk]]) 10:16, 28 September 2020 (UTC)

:Such an addition will need to explain the locations/countries where this qualification/experience is required. In some (most?) economies, there are no barriers to anyone setting up as a &quot;builder&quot; (it is not a protected term like &quot;architect&quot;).

== Article improvement ==

I have spent a few sessions trying to update this article, to make it broadly applicable to the whole field of construction (some sections were/are heavily focused on US- or UK-centric content), to explain the industry's complexity, and to indicate the scale and importance of the sector to the world economy. This is still very much work-in-progress and it would be good to get more inputs on areas which are currently only sketchily explained, and - across most sections - to add and improve references.

== Undue prominence on safety ==

Hi [[User:Dustfreeworld]]. You recently reverted a change I made to keep safety within a section about characteristics of of the construction industry. You assert &quot;Safety is not a “characteristic” of the industry. It’s a big problem caused by and also affecting the construction industry.&quot; 

Previous edits of the construction article have created a logical hierarchy of four main headings: History, Sectors, Processes, Scale and characteristics. The latter's subsections included Economic activity, Employment, Sustainability, and (until you removed it) Safety. I do not share your view that this should be added to a main section of its own. Indeed, arguably, (a lack of) sustainability is an even greater problem with causes by and impacts upon the construction sector. I think the change you made warrants further discussion here with other editors to establish a consensus for your move. You clearly have a strong interest in air and dust pollution-related matters, but, in my view, your focus on these areas is potentially skewing the construction article by making safety more prominent than other issues ([[WP:Undue]]).

I propose to revert the change and invite you to discuss it here on the article Talk page. If there is a consensus for a separate section, all well and good, but if not, safety should remain within the Scale and characteristics section. Thank you for reading (I have also left a similar note on your User Talk page). [[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 18:00, 15 September 2023 (UTC)</text>

== Article improvement ==

I have spent a few sessions trying to update this article, to make it broadly applicable to the whole field of construction (some sections were/are heavily focused on US- or UK-centric content), to explain the industry's complexity, and to indicate the scale and importance of the sector to the world economy. This is still very much work-in-progress and it would be good to get more inputs on areas which are currently only sketchily explained, and - across most sections - to add and improve references. [[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 15:47, 5 May 2020 (UTC)

Done a bit more today. Updated the barchart using 2018 UN construction GVA data, and tidied up the careers section.[[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 14:27, 26 June 2020 (UTC)

== Addition of builder ==

The addition of builder would be worth a thought under higher education. As in some countries  Builder is no longer considered a tried. In Australia a builder now has two more years experience than a tradesperson and normally a certificate four or diploma in construction. Looks forward to your reply [[User:Sntmichael|Sntmichael]] ([[User talk:Sntmichael|talk]]) 10:16, 28 September 2020 (UTC)

== Undue prominence on safety ==

Hi [[User:Dustfreeworld]]. You recently reverted a change I made to keep safety within a section about characteristics of of the construction industry. You assert &quot;Safety is not a “characteristic” of the industry. It’s a big problem caused by and also affecting the construction industry.&quot; 

Previous edits of the construction article have created a logical hierarchy of four main headings: History, Sectors, Processes, Scale and characteristics. The latter's subsections included Economic activity, Employment, Sustainability, and (until you removed it) Safety. I do not share your view that this should be added to a main section of its own. Indeed, arguably, (a lack of) sustainability is an even greater problem with causes by and impacts upon the construction sector. I think the change you made warrants further discussion here with other editors to establish a consensus for your move. You clearly have a strong interest in air and dust pollution-related matters, but, in my view, your focus on these areas is potentially skewing the construction article by making safety more prominent than other issues ([[WP:Undue]]).

I propose to revert the change and invite you to discuss it here on the article Talk page. If there is a consensus for a separate section, all well and good, but if not, safety should remain within the Scale and characteristics section. Thank you for reading (I have also left a similar note on your User Talk page). [[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 18:00, 15 September 2023 (UTC)

== Addition of builder ==

The addition of builder would be worth a thought under higher education. As in some countries  Builder is no longer considered a tried. In Australia a builder now has two more years experience than a tradesperson and normally a certificate four or diploma in construction. Looks forward to your reply [[User:Sntmichael|Sntmichael]] ([[User talk:Sntmichael|talk]]) 10:16, 28 September 2020 (UTC)

:Such an addition will need to explain the locations/countries where this qualification/experience is required. In some (most?) economies, there are no barriers to anyone setting up as a &quot;builder&quot; (it is not a protected term like &quot;architect&quot;).

== Undue prominence on safety ==

Hi [[User:Dustfreeworld]]. You recently reverted a change I made to keep safety within a section about characteristics of of the construction industry. You assert &quot;Safety is not a “characteristic” of the industry. It’s a big problem caused by and also affecting the construction industry.&quot; 

Previous edits of the construction article have created a logical hierarchy of four main headings: History, Sectors, Processes, Scale and characteristics. The latter's subsections included Economic activity, Employment, Sustainability, and (until you removed it) Safety. I do not share your view that this should be added to a main section of its own. Indeed, arguably, (a lack of) sustainability is an even greater problem with causes by and impacts upon the construction sector. I think the change you made warrants further discussion here with other editors to establish a consensus for your move. You clearly have a strong interest in air and dust pollution-related matters, but, in my view, your focus on these areas is potentially skewing the construction article by making safety more prominent than other issues ([[WP:Undue]]).

I propose to revert the change and invite you to discuss it here on the article Talk page. If there is a consensus for a separate section, all well and good, but if not, safety should remain within the Scale and characteristics section. Thank you for reading (I have also left a similar note on your User Talk page). [[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 18:00, 15 September 2023 (UTC)
