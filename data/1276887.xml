Currently, APP is listed on this page as a Chinese firm. They have operations in China, however their founder is Indonesian and the company HQ is in Jakarta. According to the article on the company itself, though, it's listed on the Singapore stock index...so what nationality should actually be listed? I'm fairly certain it isn't China.

Currently, APP is listed on this page as a Chinese firm. They have operations in China, however their founder is Indonesian and the company HQ is in Jakarta. According to the article on the company itself, though, it's listed on the Singapore stock index...so what nationality should actually be listed? I'm fairly certain it isn't China.

== AQ and Xylanase usage ==

''Use of surfactants and anthraquinone have reduced alkali consumption in Pulp Cooking and use of Xylanase enzymes in bleaching operation is effective to decreasing AOX discharges in Pulp mill effluent.''

Anthraquinone is not used anymore that I know, the reason is it being carcinogenic.
Xylanase is rarely used. It works well in a controlled lab setting but less so in pulp mills due to the varying properties of the bulk produced enzyme. 

I suggest the cited part of the article is removed.</text>
