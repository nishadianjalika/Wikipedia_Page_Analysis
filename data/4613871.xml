FOCUS

Green Revolution 
of Silane Coupling Agent Industry

by Liao Jun   General Manager  
       Wuhan University Silicone New Material Co., Ltd.  
( WD SILICONE )


Alkoxyl silane is important raw material of silicone industry, whose structure general formula is HnSi(OR)4-n, where n is 0 or 1, R is alkyl such as: -CH3、-C2H5、-C3H6 and so on. As to industry, there are four important kinds of silane: methyltrimethoxylsilane (HSi(OCH3)3)and triethoxysilane (HSi(OC2H5)3), tetramethoxysilane (Si(OCH3)4) and tetraethoxy silane (Si(OC2H5)4).
Trialkoxysilane contains both Si-OR band which can be hydrolisis and Si-H which is very active. The structure enables it to be widespreadlly used in the industry, lots of silicon based products can be synthesized from it as raw material, such as large number of carbon functional silicon (mainly be silane coupling agent in industry), the silicone resin, the alkoxy terminated agent and polysilicon which were terminated by the linear polysiloxane et.al. Tetralkoxysilane is also an important silicon intermediate in the industry, it may be used to synthesize halogenate silane or carbon functional silane, synthetic silicone resin and crosslinking silica gel used for the two-group locellus warm curing. It can also be used as the special liquid medium for inorganic parent metal surface protection coating, high pure quartz material, nano silicon dioxide and high reinforcing white carbon by wet method and so on.

Advantage of direct synthetic method processing to product Alkoxyl silane 

 There are many methods to synthesize alkoxyl siliane, and the one to be most commonly used is chlorosilane alcoholysis method in the industrial world. Silicon powder used to make HSiCl3 and SiCl4 at first, and then to react with ROH (CH3OH or C2H5OH), alkoxyl silane can be prepared as soon as the alcoholysis reaction (etherification) began. It needs to introduce and remove chlorine   during the process, which is why this technology can not well admitted when it comes to the environmental protection, energy consumption and cost aspect.
The silicon/alcohol direct synthetic method is to use silicon powder and ROH (is mainly CH3OH and C2H5OH) as raw materials, while using copper as catalyst and reacted in the organic medium, alkoxyl silane can be synthesized in only one step reaction, trialkoxysilan and tetrakloxusilane are also obtained simultaneously. It is relatively simple to form tetrakloxusilane by this way, but what the factories pursue mainly at present is high selectivity of triakyoxysilane, so it is not a wise choice to take the direct synthetic method.
The direct synthetic method has advantages in processing step, resource usage efficiency, the environmental effect and the industrial angle, as we can find the differences between the two methods easily from Fig.2.
First of all, the direct synthetic method has realized one-step synthesis, reduced the process in great degree. Secondly, it needn’t to introduce chlorine during the technological process, thus avoiding problems caused by hydrogen chloride like equipment corrosion and interruption of recycling, and has realized clean production. Thirdly, because the reduction of reactants and no high corrodent existence in the technical process, the impurity content(such as: metal impurities and chloride ion) reduce obviously, the product quality has been greatly enhancement; Fourthly, the process efficiency is high and controllable, and it needn’t to rely on the large-scale chlorosilane installment any more, may facilitate the independent establishment process units. Finally, because the reduction of the reaction steps, efficiency of raw material use and energy raised largely, because reduction of high energy consume silica power, the electric power and charcoal are saved indirectly, and the emissions of greenhouse gas carbon monoxide is reduced as well, what’s more, the production cost is also largely cut.

Fig.1 Compare of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method
The reactions of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：
1)trialkoxysilane：
HSiCl3 + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
        HSi(OR)2Cl + ROH  → ClSi(OR)3 + H2
        HSi(OR)3 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O → polymer ＋ HCl
2)tetrakloxysilane：
SiCl4 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        Si(OR)4 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O →polymer ＋ HCl
The reactions of direct synthetic method:
Si + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 + H2
HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
Side reaction：ROH + Si → RSiH(OR)2 + RSi(OR)3 + H2O + H2
        HSi(OR)3 or Si(OR)4  + H2O → ≡SiOSi≡polymer ＋ ROH 
        HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 → polymer＋ H2O

There is “revolution” as to the silane coupling agent synthesized by direct synthetic method 

In fact, Rochow discovered the direct synthetic method to prepare alkoxyl silane from lower aliphatic alcohol and silicon powder early in 1948, but it didn’t attract enough attentions due to the poor condition at that time. At the end of the 20th century, along with the increasing demand of alkoxyl silane, as well as the great attentions to the resources utilization, the cost and the environment, research and industrial production in direct synthetic method develop fast. Especially in the recent 10 years, large scale production installments to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method have been set up and to be consummated, and expanded gradually.
Momentive Performance Materials (GE silicon at the beginning) established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method in the late-1990s, and its  productivity has achieved ten thousand ton now. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method at the beginning of this century, its productivity is about several thousand tons at present. A new process unit with 10 thousand ton productivity of trialkoxylsilane was begun to build in 2008. 
The main starting points to develop scale manufacture technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane are as follow: 1) to explode cleanly and highly effective processing technology for silicon coupling agent, 2) to provide raw materials with low cost and high quality for silicon coupling agent, 3) to meet the needs of the application of related domains.

Fig.2 Compare of the process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method

Process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：





Process of direct synthetic method：





The silane coupling agent industry is an independent branch in the industry chain of silicon, the dependence to chlorosilane reduces after the successfully development of direct synthetic method. As mentioned above, the direct synthetic method has omitted the raft step which uses chlorosilane and then avoided the corrosion and pollution, result in increasing of resource utilization and high quality products. More importantly, once the technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane in a low cost can be extending scale, the silane coupling agent industry and all related downstream industries which restrained to the problems of cost, supply and environmental protection will get large-scale supply of low cost alkoxyl silane raw material, and their development bottleneck will be broken thoroughly.
The old Witco Corporation of GE silicon (whose service has merged to Momentive Performance Materials) once point out that the direct synthetic method was “a revolutionary process for manufacture of organofunctional silanes”. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd. believed that the successfully explode of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane was the technology revolution of silane coupling agent industry, and to use this new technology was the development tendency of silane coupling agent industry.

Green industrial system and complete industrial chain base on the direct synthetic method building up

1. Promotion and consummation of processing technology 
The direct synthetic method has obvious superiority when compared to the chlorosilane alcoholysis method, but there are still a great number of works to do in order to get mature stable scale processing technology. For example: to further enhance the conversion rate of raw material and the selectivity of trialkoxylsilane, to enhance the controllability and secure of the process and so on. There are processing technology difficulties in 6 aspects: 1. design of chemical reaction process, like reaction condition, catalyst choice, reaction medium choice and so on; 2. process of agitation, including considerations dispersion and reaction kinetics; 3.process of inserting alcohol during the reaction, including the consideration of fast phase transformation; 4. separation processing of trialkoxylsilane and alcohol azeotropy; 5. technology of process amplification effect or scale production; 6. reaction medium processing and cyclic utilization.
Because of many industries have been involved in development of the direct synthetic method process, problems of entire system must be considered carefully and thoroughly as to this method. The key problems are as follow. Firstly, is about the comprehensive utilization of by-products including front cut fraction, middle distillate and high-boiling product, it is mainly about comprehensive utilization of the by-products produced by side reactions fact. Secondly, dual attentions must be given to the development of lower-stream application technology of alkoxyl silane, including the development of synthesis technology of silane coupling agent and the exploitation of other new products, and to ensure the value of industry chain's development from technical angle.
After further consummation of the technology, we believe completely that alkoxyl silane as a monomer will become more and more important in the silicon industry based on the direct synthetic method process which is environment friendly the low cost. The huge and prosperous adownstream derivative industries will be well developed to form an industrial system based on alkoxyl silane produced by direct synthetic method also.
At present, industrial system based on direct synthetic method to produce alkoxyl silane is still in its development initial period, the industrial chain hasn’t been established yet, so its major impact to silicon and the related industry is not that huge as it ought to be. The innovation technology's development and the rapid expansion of scale production of direct synthetic method have already promoted the development value of alkoxyl silane industry largely from the supply and cost, which indicate a bright future for the development of the industry in it industrial chain. To the development of this industrial system, we are willing to work hard together with all the other colleagues!

Pestiside products net profit increased by 26.53% over the same period of last year. Silicone business average sales decreased in a fierce competition circumstance. Since silicone metal price rises and the purchasing is difficult owning to the earthquake, the cost of silicone production increased. Though silicone business sales income reaches to RMB 0.634 billion with an increase of 39.33% over the same period last year, net profit only increases 26.89%, a drop of 9.54% over the same period of last year.

Textile processing region mainly distributed in littoral

China's textile processing region are mainly distributed in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong and other coastal areas. In the past two years, China's printing and dyeing cloth processing volume increasing year by year, as shown in Fig. 1. The total processing amount was 3.62 million ton in 2005, then the amount rose to 4.9 million ton in 2007, the average annual growth rate was about 16.3%. The processing amount of fabric in Zhejiang province was 26.8 billion meter, accounting for 55%. Jiangsu province produced 5.4 billion meter, accounting for 11% of the national total, Shandong province produced 4.6 billion meter, Guangdong province produced 4.3 billion meter, Fujian province produced 30 million meter , as shown in Fig. 2-3.

China's total output of knitted garments was 10.72 billion in 2007, compared to7.66 billion in 2005, the increased amount was 3.06 billion, with an average annual growth rate of about 18.3 %. the output of Guangdong province whose production of knitted garment ranked first in our country was 2.98 billion, accounting for 27.8 % of total output, followed by Zhejiang’s 2.14 billion (Fig. 4). The Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007 was shown in Fig.5, and the knitted garment production in Shandong province increased faster than any other provinces, with an average annual growth rate of 26.6 %. The knitted garment production in China this year─mainly effected by the textile trade-related policies─was the same as last year. China's total volume of knitted garments was 6.29 billion from January to July in 2008, of which Guangdong province produced 1.68 billion, accounting for 26.7 % of the total (Fig. 6).

Processing variety of different textile centers
As the Chinese textile market growing, textile printing and dyeing of silicone oil consumption increased year by year. The consumption of silicone oil in China's textile printing and dyeing industries was about 38,000 ton in 2007, of which 30 % was supported by imported products, primarily imported from Dow Corning, Momentive, Shin-Etsu and Wacker. The domestic product was about 70 %, which was mainly composed by DMC, D4 and linear compound.
As to different textiles, the requirements of the silicone oil performance vary considerably, for example, chemical fiber requires slippery hand feeling and elastic performance, so the exhaustion  process was used generally. Currently, the amido-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization type) was used mostly, for the cost of the product was low, but its smoothness and elasticity need to be further improved.
The polyester sewing thread and embroidery threads used in yarn must be good at smoothness and sewing performance. And till now they have produced by the general exhaustion  process usually. Dimethyl silicone with good smoothness, low cost advantages was used primarily at present, but it still lack of fastness. Good silicone oil with good smoothness, tailoring and fastness performance should be developed in the future. The wool generally uses amino modified organosilicon softening agent at present (emulsion polymerization), the hand feeling is smooth, and the cost is low, but the product stability is low, and it is easy to be easy to delaminate and oil-disjunk, product with good stability and smooth must be developed in the future. The cotton thread has used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent also at present, which acts charitably smooth, but it was easilyy to cause detwisting and end-breakage. Due to mightness decreasing of treated yarn, most companies use Polythene wax at present.   
The cotton woven fabrics equest more smooth and softer hand feeling than any other fabrics. At present, If there were no requirement for hydrophilicity, amino-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization) would be normally adopted, result in good hand feeling and low cost, but it is easy to cause roller stick. When it comes to those cotton weave fabrics request for hydrophilicity, three kind of softening agents were used, including Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/Amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified Silicone softener. In these way, the cotton weave fabrics were hydrophilicity, no roller stick. After all, hydrophilicity and hand feeling are a pair of contradictory body, when the hydrophilicity are good, hand feeling is bad relatively. Good silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to roller stick and good sliding were still waiting for developing.
The knitted fabrics partly use amino modified organosilicon softening agent (polymerization), and the hand feeling is good, soft and fluffy while the cost is low. But it was suffered from roller stick easily and sticking cylinder easily. The other parts of knitted fabrics use Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and the Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer to match the laminated softening agent. The performance of to be not roller stick and hydrophilicity can choosed according to the demands, but it cost a lot to use these silicone oil, we must develop silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to cause roller stick, with smooth hand feeling and the fluffy, what’s more, the cost must be reduced in the future.
Woven polyester partily used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) with good smoothness and elsatic handfeeling, and its cost was low but easy roller stick. So the developing trend in the future is silicone oil with no roller stick, has good smooth and elastic handfeeling.
Two different types(one features smooth and elastic, the other features bulk) of amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) were choosed to use in T/R generally. It can make the product to have smooth, elastic handfeelingand good bulkness while the cost is low. But the disadvantage is thatApt to roller stick similarly. In addition, silicone oil produced by Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used here. It can conquer the disadvantage of apt to roller stick, while the disadvantage is that it is smoothness, elasticity and bulkness are not enough and high cost. 
The Polyester flocked fabric required the silicon to be soft, smooth, bulk and full handfeeling. And it adopt exhaustion process normally. Silicone oil usually produced by combination with two different kinds of Amino modified silicone softener (one features smooth and elastic, another one features bulk). The advantage is that it has soft and smooth handfeeling, good bulkness and low cost. And the disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick. Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used to prepare silicon oil. It is no roller stick, but lack of smoothness, bulkness, and the cost is high too.
Nylon required silicon oil to be soft and smooth handfeeling. Padding process was adopted normally. Silicone oil a form by amino modified silicone softener（bulk polymerization）was used primarily, which  owns advantage of soft and smooth handfeeling and low cost. The     disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick and the softness is not enough. When Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer were used,  the result is the it is no roller stick any more, but the disadvantage is that the softness is not enough.
As to flax, if it had no requirement for hydrophilicity, and amino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）was used to get smooth handfeeling and low cost while suffered from aptting to cause roller stick. If it had requirement for hydrophilicity, Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified silicone softener were used to obtain advantages of hydrophilicity and no roller stick but bad handfeeling relatively.
Woolen fabric required smooth and bulk handfeeling. Exhaustion process was adopted normally at present. The silicone oil used was formed by mino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）,whose advantages were good smoothness and low cost, but with disadvantages of unstable, apt to cause dilamination and oil-disjunktion. So the developing trend of silicone oil is  to produce silicon oil with good stability and smoothness to meet the requirement of the development of cowboy, cotton and kapok leisure clothing.

Silicone oil used for functional class processing applied will receive favors
The demand of silicone oil used in spinning and weaving in 2007 in our country was approximately 38,000 ton. It will increase quitely in the next everal years, especially to ready-made clothing which will grow fasfest, followed by the yarn next, and the knitting will occupy third, the weave occupies fourth.
 
Fig.7 Consumption potential (anticipating for increasing space)

Along with the diversification of textile, the demand of functionalization and high added value's silicone oil will increase. For example, the silicon oil to be used together with the hydrophilic composite in one-bath which can not effect the hydrophilic and good hand feeling were in greatly need. Silicon oil to be used together with the burning inhibitor in one-bath while the performances of flame-resistant and good hand feeling can’t be reduced were also needed. We also need silicon oil to be used togerther with the antistatic agent in one-bath to keep an anti-static electricity performance. To sum up, the great requirement of silicon to be used together with the hydrophilic, flame-resistant, soft, the anti-static electricity composites in one-bath, then fabric can be endowed with many kinds of functions as shown above. What’s more, if it was used together with the fixing agent in one-bath, their properties such as the hand feeling and color fastness can’t be affected.
The unceasingly pursue of the textile’s good performance will promote the silicone oil’s functionality. For example, silicon oil which can be used together with the dyeing in one-bath, silicon oil with super chemical stability which can be used used in jet machine, cotton-used silicone oil has cool hand feeling, new product can increase handfeeling and wet rubbing fastness. Silicone base color deepening agent, it can impart fabric with excellent color deepening effect. Stock stability is good. No effect to color fastness and good hand feeling.
The requirement for expanding application field of silicon product's will be further developed. Such as: silicone glue used in printing, silicone used in coating, silicone rubber which is compatible with printing and coating chemicals, silicone combined with polyurther to be used in coating, silicone combined with acrylic acid to be used in printing, silicone combined with fluocarbon to be used in water proof and so on.
As the rise of raw material's cost, the international pressure of the textile industry increases day by day. The textile of our country will trend to use functional and upscale silicone oil. What’s more, the environmental protection and energy conservation will also promote the silicone oil to be greener and more environmentally friendly.

Polycrystalline Silicon – What to Do?

By Bai Hongqiang, China National Chemical Information Center



1. Upsurge of polycrystalline silicon

Polycrystalline silicon is a basic material with extensive applications in the electronics and solar photovoltaic sectors. It was not very well known in the past. In the development of alternative energies triggered by the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; solar cell manufacturers have expanded capacity and their demand for polycrystalline silicon has grown rapidly. A serious supply shortage of polycrystalline silicon has developed all over the world. Despite full-capacity operation in most existing polycrystalline silicon units, the market demand can hardly be satisfied. The price of polycrystalline silicon has increased constantly, exceeding US$400 per kg at the end of 2007. The rising price has generated fat profits for producers. According to an annual performance statement published by a domestic polycrystalline silicon producer with a capacity of 50 t/a, the target of accomplishing a profit of RMB100 million in 2007 was attained in October 2007. 
Stimulated by fat profits, domestic polycrystalline silicon producers have expanded their capacities at an astonishing rate. The new capacity in China will reach 160 000-190 000 t/a in the next few years. More than 30 construction projects are planned, and most of them will start production around 2010. 
&quot;The growth of the photovoltaic sector is a dangerous thing,&quot; pointed out a report on the sector in 2007 prepared by a securities research institute. Although experts have constantly adjusted their forecasts upward, they always underestimate the demand growth in the market. 
It should be noted that government forces are also involved in this tide and have become one of the major features in this investment fever. According to statistics, governments of nearly 20 provinces and municipalities have already regarded the photovoltaic sector as the focus in the development of new sectors and the transformation of old sectors. They are all planning to launch polycrystalline silicon projects. 

2. Questions in the development of polycrystalline silicon

The major sector driving the growth of polycrystalline silicon market is the solar cell sector. Quality requirements for polycrystalline silicon used in electronics such as semiconductors are much higher than for solar-grade. Even for the solar-grade varieties, the production using smelting and purification are very difficult. The mainstream process for the production of polycrystalline silicon used today is the chemical method. The modified Siemens process (also called the HSiCl3 process) is the most popular. Comparatively speaking, the ASiMI process (the SiH4 process) and the granular polycrystalline silicon manufacturing technology and smelting process are not often used. 
The Siemens process uses HSiCl3 as raw material and consumes a great deal of material and energy. It has considerable impact on the indirect-process silane coupling agent sector, which also uses HSiCl3 as raw material. No matter what method is used, polycrystalline silicon production consumes great quantities of industrial silicon as the starting material. There is therefore a huge potential impact on the organosilicon sector, which also uses industrial silicon as raw material. 
Take the modified Siemens process for instance. Producing one ton of polycrystalline silicon needs around 10 tons of HSiCl3 (equivalent to 3.5 tons of industrial silicon). According to the estimates made by China Electronics Materials Industry Association, the output of polycrystalline silicon in China will reach around 3 000 tons in 2008, the consumption of HSiCl3 in the polycrystalline silicon sector will be around 30 000 tons and the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be around 10 000 tons. 
The output of industrial silicon in China is around 700 000 tons today. Two thirds of the output is exported. The remaining one third is used in the domestic market. Around 60% of it is used in organosilicon production and the balance is used in alloy casting. The organosilicon sector is developing rapidly today. It is expected that the capacity to make organosilicon monomer will reach around 1.80 million t/a in 2010 and the consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by more than 450 000 tons.
If one third (around 60 000 t/a) of polycrystalline silicon projects planned for construction and expansion start production in 2010 and all of them use the Siemens process, the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by around 200 000 tons. When the difference in the technical level of these units is considered, the actual consumption will likely be higher. 
Something can already been seen from the market price trend of HSiCl3 in the past year or so. The price of HSiCl3 that was only an intermediate product and had small circulation in the silane coupling agent sector is still increasing dramatically today. By early March 2008 it rose to RMB19 000 per ton, more than doubling the price in just one year, and there are no signs whatsoever of the price going down. Besides the cost increase caused by the price rise of industrial silicon, the sudden entrance of polycrystalline silicon producers into the market as buyers is also an important reason for the skyrocketing price rise. Although most polycrystalline silicon producers have their own raw material units and hence do not purchase much HSiCl3, sales of HSiCl3 have still increased remarkably in recent years due to the great number of projects and buyers. 
Silane coupling agent producers using the indirect process are faced with a dilemma. They can achieve raw material self-sufficiency through purchasing industrial silicon themselves and protect themselves from the supply shortage and price rise of HSiCl3, but the price of industrial silicon has already grown rapidly, other costs are also on the increase, the competition in the downstream market has become fierce and it is harder to assure profits. In case the margin is further narrowed and the price of HSiCl3 increases further, how should silane coupling agent producers readjust their business? Should they make the direct sales of HSiCl3 to get profits or should they increase the price of products or improve the process to better their operation? 
In a not too distant future, the impacts of the drastic capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon on organosilicon enterprises will perhaps appear along with a competition for raw material industrial silicon. If the consumption of industrial silicon for polycrystalline silicon reaches 200 000 tons in 2010, its proportion of the total demand of industrial silicon will be around a quarter. The demand for industrial silicon in the organosilicon and alloy sectors will also increase drastically during that period. If the growth in the supply of industrial silicon slows down, polycrystalline silicon producers that have a strong financial standing will surely buy at high prices to ensure their own raw material supply. Some organosilicon enterprises that have made no breakthroughs in their high-end downstream consumption sectors and large-scale production technologies will very likely find themselves in a predicament in the next few years. 
It may not be possible to relieve the raw material shortage through rapid growth of the industrial silicon supply. Because production of industrial silicon is energy intensive, output in advanced countries has already shrunk greatly. China will no longer grant incentives for its production either, as evidenced by the readjustment to the export rebate and the export tariff policy and the elimination of the differential power price since early 2005. In such a scenario there is slim possibility of doubling the output of industrial silicon in China within three years to meet the domestic demand. 

3. Technical innovation: the best solution to raw material shortage

The negative impact of polycrystalline silicon production on the organosilicon sector is mainly reflected in the competition for raw material. That impact can be reduced in three cases. The first is that the total capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon turns out to be less than has been forecast. The second is that the supply of industrial silicon grows rapidly, but that prospect is already proved to be improbable. The third is that a new technical route is opened up, bypassing industrial silicon in producing either organosilicon or polycrystalline silicon, or remarkably increasing the utilization rate of silicon in polycrystalline silicon production.
The core technology for polycrystalline silicon production is monopolized by the United States, Japan and Germany. In spite of technical development over several years in Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., which started the first large-scale production in China and are still expanding capacity today, their technical level still lags behind foreign giants. 
Aside from these two companies, other projects in China have diversified technology sources and their technical personnel are mostly from the limited pool cultivated by Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. with many years' efforts. There is therefore a considerable risk of technological inadequacies in the smooth completion of these large projects, launched in haste. 
Besides, most of the projects launched in China will produce solar-grade products and target the photovoltaic cell. There will not be many electronic-grade products. Reasons for this are two. One is that enterprises take an unduly optimistic attitude toward the world photovoltaic power generation market. The other is that the technology for making electronic-grade products is not easily available. The reality, however, is that downstream of electronic-grade products is the large-scale IT industry with a great demand whereas the development fever of solar-grade products is mostly based on a demand that is not nearly so firmly established - the still-immature photovoltaic power generation market and a heavy reliance on incentives from various national governments. According to experts including Liu Hanyuan, the new downstream photovoltaic cell projects are more than polycrystalline silicon projects. Like the polycrystalline silicon sector, the capacity expansion of these photovoltaic cell projects is mainly located in China but the target market is mostly in foreign countries. Why is the capacity expansion made by foreign giants that have operated for several dozen years much slower than domestic enterprises? It is uncertain whether the new capacity to make photovoltaic cells can be smoothly digested in China, let alone the polycrystalline silicon capacity. History has shown that new things strongly advocated by governments or industrial circles do not necessarily turn out to be society's choice in the long run. Take one step back - even if photovoltaic power generation proves to be an energy alternative suitable to the national conditions in China, the actual growth of the market demand is yet to be verified. 
Making improvements to polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon manufacturing routes is likely to be the most feasible solution to the raw material supply shortage. In the polycrystalline silicon sector, if the proportion of smelting-process polycrystalline silicon is increased, the consumption of industrial silicon can be reduced and there is no problem of raw material shortage. If the utilization rate of silicon in the Siemens-process polycrystalline silicon production is increased, the industrial silicon supply shortage can also be very well eased. 
Another method is to combine organosilicon with polycrystalline silicon to achieve resource complementation and joint development. Guangzhou GBS High-Tech &amp; Industry Co., Ltd. is going all out to use byproduct silicon tetrachloride in the polycrystalline silicon production to produce gaseous-process silica white. Hydrogen, hydrogen chloride and HSiCl3 separated in the production can be recycled to the process. In this way the pollutant emission is reduced, the economic performance is improved and the bottleneck that has constrained the development of the polycrystalline silicon sector for so many years can also be removed. 
The fundamental way to solve the raw material supply shortage in the polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon production is the vigorous development of organosilicon chemistry. These two products have extensive applications. They are different from each other but come from the same element, silicon. Silicon is one of the most plentiful elements on earth. Its crust abundance is 25.8%, second only to oxygen and much higher than carbon. Silicon dioxide or silicates formed in the natural world can be seen everywhere. If silicon in the earth's crust can be used to directly synthesize organosilicon intermediates or products at a low cost, omitting the industrial silicon smelting that consumes great quantities of resources and power, organosilicon and polycrystalline silicon productions would benefit from inexhaustible low-priced raw material sources, and the development of these two chemical products and related sectors would enter a new era. 


Analysis of the World Trade of Metal Silicon
By kertherine mane ,CNCIC



Ⅰ. World imports

Silicon is a structural and functional material widely used in contemporary high-tech fields and important basic industries. It not only produces the semiconductor-grade polysilicon and optical fiber materials, but also is an indispensable basic raw materials in organic silicon industry. The H.S. Codes (Harmonized System Codes) of the silicon product discussed in this paper is 28046900. Japan, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands are four of the world's largest silicons importing countries. 2006-2007，the annual import amount of the silicons in these countries are more than 100 kiloton, and in 2007 these four countries contributed 58.4 percents of the total imports in the world.
Since 2002, the average unit import price of the silicon has been rising around the world. The price was 1,036 US$/ton in 2002, increased to 1,143 US$/ton in 2003, reached to 1,330 US$/ton in 2004, 1,383 US$/ton in 2005, and kept rising in 2006 when the price is 1,419 US$/ton. As the impact of high oil prices, in the year 2007, the average unit import price of the silicon increased by 25.8 percent of its in 2006, reached 1785 US$/ton.
Japan is the world's largest silicon importing country. Its annual import amount has raised from 189.7 kiloton in 2002 to 252 kiloton in 2007, the average annual growth rate is 5.8%. Since 2003, its annual import amount has been kept over 200 kiloton. China is Japan's largest source of silicon. In 2005, the amount of silicon importing from China to Japan was 85.8% of the total amount of silicon imports in Japan. This ratio increased to 89.2% in 2006, and 91.5% in 2007.
Germany is the world's second-largest silicon importing country. Brazil, Norway, France and the Netherlands are the main original country providing more than 70 percents of the imported silicon for Germany each year. Since 2005, the import volumes from Norway and the Netherlands have decreased, while the import volume from Brazil, France, Canada, Russia and China continue to increase. Imports from China surged from 2 kiloton in 2005 to 14.8 kiloton in 2006.
As the world's third largest importing country of silicon, the import volume of silicon of the United States has reduced in recent years. Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Australia and Norway are the main original country of the silicon for the United States.
 
Fig.2  Main importers of metal silicon from 2002 to 2007

Ⅱ. World exports 

South Africa had been the world's largest silicon exporting country. In 2002, South Africa exported 583.9 kiloton silicon, which was 39% of the total world exports. In 2003, its export volume rose to 767.1 kiloton, accounting for 29.7% of the total world exports. Because the silicon plant Ferroatlantica in South Africa stopped production, the export volume of silicon sharply declined from 556.6 kiloton in 2004 to 57.8 kiloton in 2005. In the year 2006 and 2007, the export volume of silicon in South Africa kept below 50 kiloton, only accounting for 4% of the world's total export volume. China used to be the world's second largest exporting country of silicon, in 2005, China has taken the place of the South Africa to be the world's largest silicon exporting country. China's share of the world export of the silicon have been increasing each year, from 25.9% in 2002, 18.5% in 2003, to 51% in 2006 and 53.3% in 2007. Brazil and Norway are two of the most important exporting countries of the silicon in the world, whose annual export volume is more than 140 kiloton.
Since 2003, the world’s average unit price of the exported silicon was only 447 US$/ton and this price almost doubled to 865 US$/ton in 2004. It kept comparatively stable in 2005 and 2006, 1,301 US$/ton and 1,326 US$/ton respectively. Due to the increase of the international energy price, the average unit price of the exported silicon climbed to 1,634 US$/ton in 2007.
China's export volume of the silicon is increasing year by year. In 2002, China exported 387.6 kiloton of the silicon, and in 2007 this figure reached 698.3 kiloton., The average annual growth rate is 12.5% during 2002 ~ 2007. China exports silicon to more than 50 countries and regions in the world. Japan has been China's biggest export destination, taking up 32% of the total export volume of China in recent years. China exports silicon to other countries and regions including Hong Kong, Korea, the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, the Netherlands and Canada.

Green Revolution 
of Silane Coupling Agent Industry

by Liao Jun   General Manager  
       Wuhan University Silicone New Material Co., Ltd.  
( WD SILICONE )


Alkoxyl silane is important raw material of bitch industry, whose structure general formula is HnSi(OR)4-n, where n is 0 or 1, R is alkyl such as: -CH3、-C2H5、-C3H6 and so on. As to industry, there are four important kinds of silane: methyltrimethoxylsilane (HSi(OCH3)3)and triethoxysilane (HSi(OC2H5)3), tetramethoxysilane (Si(OCH3)4) and tetraethoxy silane (Si(OC2H5)4).
Trialkoxysilane contains both Si-OR band which can be hydrolisis and Si-H which is very active. The structure enables it to be widespreadlly used in the industry, lots of silicon based products can be synthesized from it as raw material, such as large number of carbon functional silicon (mainly be silane coupling agent in industry), the silicone resin, the alkoxy terminated agent and polysilicon which were terminated by the linear polysiloxane et.al. Tetralkoxysilane is also an important silicon intermediate in the industry, it may be used to synthesize halogenate silane or carbon functional silane, synthetic silicone resin and crosslinking silica gel used for the two-group locellus warm curing. It can also be used as the special liquid medium for inorganic parent metal surface protection coating, high pure quartz material, nano silicon dioxide and high reinforcing white carbon by wet method and so on.

Advantage of direct synthetic method processing to product Alkoxyl silane 

 There are many methods to synthesize alkoxyl siliane, and the one to be most commonly used is chlorosilane alcoholysis method in the industrial world. Silicon powder used to make HSiCl3 and SiCl4 at first, and then to react with ROH (CH3OH or C2H5OH), alkoxyl silane can be prepared as soon as the alcoholysis reaction (etherification) began. It needs to introduce and remove chlorine   during the process, which is why this technology can not well admitted when it comes to the environmental protection, energy consumption and cost aspect.
The silicon/alcohol direct synthetic method is to use silicon powder and ROH (is mainly CH3OH and C2H5OH) as raw materials, while using copper as catalyst and reacted in the organic medium, alkoxyl silane can be synthesized in only one step reaction, trialkoxysilan and tetrakloxusilane are also obtained simultaneously. It is relatively simple to form tetrakloxusilane by this way, but what the factories pursue mainly at present is high selectivity of triakyoxysilane, so it is not a wise choice to take the direct synthetic method.
The direct synthetic method has advantages in processing step, resource usage efficiency, the environmental effect and the industrial angle, as we can find the differences between the two methods easily from Fig.2.
First of all, the direct synthetic method has realized one-step synthesis, reduced the process in great degree. Secondly, it needn’t to introduce chlorine during the technological process, thus avoiding problems caused by hydrogen chloride like equipment corrosion and interruption of recycling, and has realized clean production. Thirdly, because the reduction of reactants and no high corrodent existence in the technical process, the impurity content(such as: metal impurities and chloride ion) reduce obviously, the product quality has been greatly enhancement; Fourthly, the process efficiency is high and controllable, and it needn’t to rely on the large-scale chlorosilane installment any more, may facilitate the independent establishment process units. Finally, because the reduction of the reaction steps, efficiency of raw material use and energy raised largely, because reduction of high energy consume silica power, the electric power and charcoal are saved indirectly, and the emissions of greenhouse gas carbon monoxide is reduced as well, what’s more, the production cost is also largely cut.

Fig.1 Compare of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method
The reactions of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：
1)trialkoxysilane：
HSiCl3 + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
        HSi(OR)2Cl + ROH  → ClSi(OR)3 + H2
        HSi(OR)3 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O → polymer ＋ HCl
2)tetrakloxysilane：
SiCl4 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        Si(OR)4 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O →polymer ＋ HCl
The reactions of direct synthetic method:
Si + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 + H2
HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
Side reaction：ROH + Si → RSiH(OR)2 + RSi(OR)3 + H2O + H2
        HSi(OR)3 or Si(OR)4  + H2O → ≡SiOSi≡polymer ＋ ROH 
        HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 → polymer＋ H2O

There is “revolution” as to the silane coupling agent synthesized by direct synthetic method 

In fact, Rochow discovered the direct synthetic method to prepare alkoxyl silane from lower aliphatic alcohol and silicon powder early in 1948, but it didn’t attract enough attentions due to the poor condition at that time. At the end of the 20th century, along with the increasing demand of alkoxyl silane, as well as the great attentions to the resources utilization, the cost and the environment, research and industrial production in direct synthetic method develop fast. Especially in the recent 10 years, large scale production installments to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method have been set up and to be consummated, and expanded gradually.
Momentive Performance Materials (GE silicon at the beginning) established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method in the late-1990s, and its  productivity has achieved ten thousand ton now. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method at the beginning of this century, its productivity is about several thousand tons at present. A new process unit with 10 thousand ton productivity of trialkoxylsilane was begun to build in 2008. 
The main starting points to develop scale manufacture technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane are as follow: 1) to explode cleanly and highly effective processing technology for silicon coupling agent, 2) to provide raw materials with low cost and high quality for silicon coupling agent, 3) to meet the needs of the application of related domains.

Fig.2 Compare of the process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method

Process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：





Process of direct synthetic method：





The silane coupling agent industry is an independent branch in the industry chain of silicon, the dependence to chlorosilane reduces after the successfully development of direct synthetic method. As mentioned above, the direct synthetic method has omitted the raft step which uses chlorosilane and then avoided the corrosion and pollution, result in increasing of resource utilization and high quality products. More importantly, once the technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane in a low cost can be extending scale, the silane coupling agent industry and all related downstream industries which restrained to the problems of cost, supply and environmental protection will get large-scale supply of low cost alkoxyl silane raw material, and their development bottleneck will be broken thoroughly.
The old Witco Corporation of GE silicon (whose service has merged to Momentive Performance Materials) once point out that the direct synthetic method was “a revolutionary process for manufacture of organofunctional silanes”. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd. believed that the successfully explode of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane was the technology revolution of silane coupling agent industry, and to use this new technology was the development tendency of silane coupling agent industry.

Green industrial system and complete industrial chain base on the direct synthetic method building up

1. Promotion and consummation of processing technology 
The direct synthetic method has obvious superiority when compared to the chlorosilane alcoholysis method, but there are still a great number of works to do in order to get mature stable scale processing technology. For example: to further enhance the conversion rate of raw material and the selectivity of trialkoxylsilane, to enhance the controllability and secure of the process and so on. There are processing technology difficulties in 6 aspects: 1. design of chemical reaction process, like reaction condition, catalyst choice, reaction medium choice and so on; 2. process of agitation, including considerations dispersion and reaction kinetics; 3.process of inserting alcohol during the reaction, including the consideration of fast phase transformation; 4. separation processing of trialkoxylsilane and alcohol azeotropy; 5. technology of process amplification effect or scale production; 6. reaction medium processing and cyclic utilization.
Because of many industries have been involved in development of the direct synthetic method process, problems of entire system must be considered carefully and thoroughly as to this method. The key problems are as follow. Firstly, is about the comprehensive utilization of by-products including front cut fraction, middle distillate and high-boiling product, it is mainly about comprehensive utilization of the by-products produced by side reactions fact. Secondly, dual attentions must be given to the development of lower-stream application technology of alkoxyl silane, including the development of synthesis technology of silane coupling agent and the exploitation of other new products, and to ensure the value of industry chain's development from technical angle.
After further consummation of the technology, we believe completely that alkoxyl silane as a monomer will become more and more important in the silicon industry based on the direct synthetic method process which is environment friendly the low cost. The huge and prosperous adownstream derivative industries will be well developed to form an industrial system based on alkoxyl silane produced by direct synthetic method also.
At present, industrial system based on direct synthetic method to produce alkoxyl silane is still in its development initial period, the industrial chain hasn’t been established yet, so its major impact to silicon and the related industry is not that huge as it ought to be. The innovation technology's development and the rapid expansion of scale production of direct synthetic method have already promoted the development value of alkoxyl silane industry largely from the supply and cost, which indicate a bright future for the development of the industry in it industrial chain. To the development of this industrial system, we are willing to work hard together with all the other colleagues!

The Application and Prospects of Silicone Used in Chinese Textile Industry
  by  Ju-Tao Luo  Deputy manager  Zhejiang Transfar Co., Led,



Textile processing region mainly distributed in littoral

China's textile processing region are mainly distributed in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong and other coastal areas. In the past two years, China's printing and dyeing cloth processing volume increasing year by year, as shown in Fig. 1. The total processing amount was 3.62 million ton in 2005, then the amount rose to 4.9 million ton in 2007, the average annual growth rate was about 16.3%. The processing amount of fabric in Zhejiang province was 26.8 billion meter, accounting for 55%. Jiangsu province produced 5.4 billion meter, accounting for 11% of the national total, Shandong province produced 4.6 billion meter, Guangdong province produced 4.3 billion meter, Fujian province produced 30 million meter , as shown in Fig. 2-3.

Fig.3 Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007
China's total output of knitted garments was 10.72 billion in 2007, compared to7.66 billion in 2005, the increased amount was 3.06 billion, with an average annual growth rate of about 18.3 %. the output of Guangdong province whose production of knitted garment ranked first in our country was 2.98 billion, accounting for 27.8 % of total output, followed by Zhejiang’s 2.14 billion (Fig. 4). The Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007 was shown in Fig.5, and the knitted garment production in Shandong province increased faster than any other provinces, with an average annual growth rate of 26.6 %. The knitted garment production in China this year─mainly effected by the textile trade-related policies─was the same as last year. China's total volume of knitted garments was 6.29 billion from January to July in 2008, of which Guangdong province produced 1.68 billion, accounting for 26.7 % of the total (Fig. 6).

Processing variety of different textile centers
As the Chinese textile market growing, textile printing and dyeing of silicone oil consumption increased year by year. The consumption of silicone oil in China's textile printing and dyeing industries was about 38,000 ton in 2007, of which 30 % was supported by imported products, primarily imported from Dow Corning, Momentive, Shin-Etsu and Wacker. The domestic product was about 70 %, which was mainly composed by DMC, D4 and linear compound.
As to different textiles, the requirements of the silicone oil performance vary considerably, for example, chemical fiber requires slippery hand feeling and elastic performance, so the exhaustion  process was used generally. Currently, the amido-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization type) was used mostly, for the cost of the product was low, but its smoothness and elasticity need to be further improved.
The polyester sewing thread and embroidery threads used in yarn must be good at smoothness and sewing performance. And till now they have produced by the general exhaustion  process usually. Dimethyl silicone with good smoothness, low cost advantages was used primarily at present, but it still lack of fastness. Good silicone oil with good smoothness, tailoring and fastness performance should be developed in the future. The wool generally uses amino modified organosilicon softening agent at present (emulsion polymerization), the hand feeling is smooth, and the cost is low, but the product stability is low, and it is easy to be easy to delaminate and oil-disjunk, product with good stability and smooth must be developed in the future. The cotton thread has used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent also at present, which acts charitably smooth, but it was easilyy to cause detwisting and end-breakage. Due to mightness decreasing of treated yarn, most companies use Polythene wax at present.   
The cotton woven fabrics equest more smooth and softer hand feeling than any other fabrics. At present, If there were no requirement for hydrophilicity, amino-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization) would be normally adopted, result in good hand feeling and low cost, but it is easy to cause roller stick. When it comes to those cotton weave fabrics request for hydrophilicity, three kind of softening agents were used, including Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/Amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified Silicone softener. In these way, the cotton weave fabrics were hydrophilicity, no roller stick. After all, hydrophilicity and hand feeling are a pair of contradictory body, when the hydrophilicity are good, hand feeling is bad relatively. Good silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to roller stick and good sliding were still waiting for developing.
The knitted fabrics partly use amino modified organosilicon softening agent (polymerization), and the hand feeling is good, soft and fluffy while the cost is low. But it was suffered from roller stick easily and sticking cylinder easily. The other parts of knitted fabrics use Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and the Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer to match the laminated softening agent. The performance of to be not roller stick and hydrophilicity can choosed according to the demands, but it cost a lot to use these silicone oil, we must develop silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to cause roller stick, with smooth hand feeling and the fluffy, what’s more, the cost must be reduced in the future.
Woven polyester partily used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) with good smoothness and elsatic handfeeling, and its cost was low but easy roller stick. So the developing trend in the future is silicone oil with no roller stick, has good smooth and elastic handfeeling.
Two different types(one features smooth and elastic, the other features bulk) of amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) were choosed to use in T/R generally. It can make the product to have smooth, elastic handfeelingand good bulkness while the cost is low. But the disadvantage is thatApt to roller stick similarly. In addition, silicone oil produced by Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used here. It can conquer the disadvantage of apt to roller stick, while the disadvantage is that it is smoothness, elasticity and bulkness are not enough and high cost. 
The Polyester flocked fabric required the silicon to be soft, smooth, bulk and full handfeeling. And it adopt exhaustion process normally. Silicone oil usually produced by combination with two different kinds of Amino modified silicone softener (one features smooth and elastic, another one features bulk). The advantage is that it has soft and smooth handfeeling, good bulkness and low cost. And the disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick. Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used to prepare silicon oil. It is no roller stick, but lack of smoothness, bulkness, and the cost is high too.
Nylon required silicon oil to be soft and smooth handfeeling. Padding process was adopted normally. Silicone oil a form by amino modified silicone softener（bulk polymerization）was used primarily, which  owns advantage of soft and smooth handfeeling and low cost. The     disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick and the softness is not enough. When Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer were used,  the result is the it is no roller stick any more, but the disadvantage is that the softness is not enough.
As to flax, if it had no requirement for hydrophilicity, and amino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）was used to get smooth handfeeling and low cost while suffered from aptting to cause roller stick. If it had requirement for hydrophilicity, Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified silicone softener were used to obtain advantages of hydrophilicity and no roller stick but bad handfeeling relatively.
Woolen fabric required smooth and bulk handfeeling. Exhaustion process was adopted normally at present. The silicone oil used was formed by mino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）,whose advantages were good smoothness and low cost, but with disadvantages of unstable, apt to cause dilamination and oil-disjunktion. So the developing trend of silicone oil is  to produce silicon oil with good stability and smoothness to meet the requirement of the development of cowboy, cotton and kapok leisure clothing.

Silicone oil used for functional class processing applied will receive favors
The demand of silicone oil used in spinning and weaving in 2007 in our country was approximately 38,000 ton. It will increase quitely in the next everal years, especially to ready-made clothing which will grow fasfest, followed by the yarn next, and the knitting will occupy third, the weave occupies fourth.
 
Fig.7 Consumption potential (anticipating for increasing space)

Along with the diversification of textile, the demand of functionalization and high added value's silicone oil will increase. For example, the silicon oil to be used together with the hydrophilic composite in one-bath which can not effect the hydrophilic and good hand feeling were in greatly need. Silicon oil to be used together with the burning inhibitor in one-bath while the performances of flame-resistant and good hand feeling can’t be reduced were also needed. We also need silicon oil to be used togerther with the antistatic agent in one-bath to keep an anti-static electricity performance. To sum up, the great requirement of silicon to be used together with the hydrophilic, flame-resistant, soft, the anti-static electricity composites in one-bath, then fabric can be endowed with many kinds of functions as shown above. What’s more, if it was used together with the fixing agent in one-bath, their properties such as the hand feeling and color fastness can’t be affected.
The unceasingly pursue of the textile’s good performance will promote the silicone oil’s functionality. For example, silicon oil which can be used together with the dyeing in one-bath, silicon oil with super chemical stability which can be used used in jet machine, cotton-used silicone oil has cool hand feeling, new product can increase handfeeling and wet rubbing fastness. Silicone base color deepening agent, it can impart fabric with excellent color deepening effect. Stock stability is good. No effect to color fastness and good hand feeling.
The requirement for expanding application field of silicon product's will be further developed. Such as: silicone glue used in printing, silicone used in coating, silicone rubber which is compatible with printing and coating chemicals, silicone combined with polyurther to be used in coating, silicone combined with acrylic acid to be used in printing, silicone combined with fluocarbon to be used in water proof and so on.
As the rise of raw material's cost, the international pressure of the textile industry increases day by day. The textile of our country will trend to use functional and upscale silicone oil. What’s more, the environmental protection and energy conservation will also promote the silicone oil to be greener and more environmentally friendly.

Polycrystalline Silicon – What to Do?

By Bai Hongqiang, China National Chemical Information Center



1. Upsurge of polycrystalline silicon

Polycrystalline silicon is a basic material with extensive applications in the electronics and solar photovoltaic sectors. It was not very well known in the past. In the development of alternative energies triggered by the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; solar cell manufacturers have expanded capacity and their demand for polycrystalline silicon has grown rapidly. A serious supply shortage of polycrystalline silicon has developed all over the world. Despite full-capacity operation in most existing polycrystalline silicon units, the market demand can hardly be satisfied. The price of polycrystalline silicon has increased constantly, exceeding US$400 per kg at the end of 2007. The rising price has generated fat profits for producers. According to an annual performance statement published by a domestic polycrystalline silicon producer with a capacity of 50 t/a, the target of accomplishing a profit of RMB100 million in 2007 was attained in October 2007. 
Stimulated by fat profits, domestic polycrystalline silicon producers have expanded their capacities at an astonishing rate. The new capacity in China will reach 160 000-190 000 t/a in the next few years. More than 30 construction projects are planned, and most of them will start production around 2010. 
&quot;The growth of the photovoltaic sector is a dangerous thing,&quot; pointed out a report on the sector in 2007 prepared by a securities research institute. Although experts have constantly adjusted their forecasts upward, they always underestimate the demand growth in the market. 
It should be noted that government forces are also involved in this tide and have become one of the major features in this investment fever. According to statistics, governments of nearly 20 provinces and municipalities have already regarded the photovoltaic sector as the focus in the development of new sectors and the transformation of old sectors. They are all planning to launch polycrystalline silicon projects. 

2. Questions in the development of polycrystalline silicon

The major sector driving the growth of polycrystalline silicon market is the solar cell sector. Quality requirements for polycrystalline silicon used in electronics such as semiconductors are much higher than for solar-grade. Even for the solar-grade varieties, the production using smelting and purification are very difficult. The mainstream process for the production of polycrystalline silicon used today is the chemical method. The modified Siemens process (also called the HSiCl3 process) is the most popular. Comparatively speaking, the ASiMI process (the SiH4 process) and the granular polycrystalline silicon manufacturing technology and smelting process are not often used. 
The Siemens process uses HSiCl3 as raw material and consumes a great deal of material and energy. It has considerable impact on the indirect-process silane coupling agent sector, which also uses HSiCl3 as raw material. No matter what method is used, polycrystalline silicon production consumes great quantities of industrial silicon as the starting material. There is therefore a huge potential impact on the organosilicon sector, which also uses industrial silicon as raw material. 
Take the modified Siemens process for instance. Producing one ton of polycrystalline silicon needs around 10 tons of HSiCl3 (equivalent to 3.5 tons of industrial silicon). According to the estimates made by China Electronics Materials Industry Association, the output of polycrystalline silicon in China will reach around 3 000 tons in 2008, the consumption of HSiCl3 in the polycrystalline silicon sector will be around 30 000 tons and the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be around 10 000 tons. 
The output of industrial silicon in China is around 700 000 tons today. Two thirds of the output is exported. The remaining one third is used in the domestic market. Around 60% of it is used in organosilicon production and the balance is used in alloy casting. The organosilicon sector is developing rapidly today. It is expected that the capacity to make organosilicon monomer will reach around 1.80 million t/a in 2010 and the consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by more than 450 000 tons.
If one third (around 60 000 t/a) of polycrystalline silicon projects planned for construction and expansion start production in 2010 and all of them use the Siemens process, the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by around 200 000 tons. When the difference in the technical level of these units is considered, the actual consumption will likely be higher. 
Something can already been seen from the market price trend of HSiCl3 in the past year or so. The price of HSiCl3 that was only an intermediate product and had small circulation in the silane coupling agent sector is still increasing dramatically today. By early March 2008 it rose to RMB19 000 per ton, more than doubling the price in just one year, and there are no signs whatsoever of the price going down. Besides the cost increase caused by the price rise of industrial silicon, the sudden entrance of polycrystalline silicon producers into the market as buyers is also an important reason for the skyrocketing price rise. Although most polycrystalline silicon producers have their own raw material units and hence do not purchase much HSiCl3, sales of HSiCl3 have still increased remarkably in recent years due to the great number of projects and buyers. 
Silane coupling agent producers using the indirect process are faced with a dilemma. They can achieve raw material self-sufficiency through purchasing industrial silicon themselves and protect themselves from the supply shortage and price rise of HSiCl3, but the price of industrial silicon has already grown rapidly, other costs are also on the increase, the competition in the downstream market has become fierce and it is harder to assure profits. In case the margin is further narrowed and the price of HSiCl3 increases further, how should silane coupling agent producers readjust their business? Should they make the direct sales of HSiCl3 to get profits or should they increase the price of products or improve the process to better their operation? 
In a not too distant future, the impacts of the drastic capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon on organosilicon enterprises will perhaps appear along with a competition for raw material industrial silicon. If the consumption of industrial silicon for polycrystalline silicon reaches 200 000 tons in 2010, its proportion of the total demand of industrial silicon will be around a quarter. The demand for industrial silicon in the organosilicon and alloy sectors will also increase drastically during that period. If the growth in the supply of industrial silicon slows down, polycrystalline silicon producers that have a strong financial standing will surely buy at high prices to ensure their own raw material supply. Some organosilicon enterprises that have made no breakthroughs in their high-end downstream consumption sectors and large-scale production technologies will very likely find themselves in a predicament in the next few years. 
It may not be possible to relieve the raw material shortage through rapid growth of the industrial silicon supply. Because production of industrial silicon is energy intensive, output in advanced countries has already shrunk greatly. China will no longer grant incentives for its production either, as evidenced by the readjustment to the export rebate and the export tariff policy and the elimination of the differential power price since early 2005. In such a scenario there is slim possibility of doubling the output of industrial silicon in China within three years to meet the domestic demand. 

3. Technical innovation: the best solution to raw material shortage

The negative impact of polycrystalline silicon production on the organosilicon sector is mainly reflected in the competition for raw material. That impact can be reduced in three cases. The first is that the total capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon turns out to be less than has been forecast. The second is that the supply of industrial silicon grows rapidly, but that prospect is already proved to be improbable. The third is that a new technical route is opened up, bypassing industrial silicon in producing either organosilicon or polycrystalline silicon, or remarkably increasing the utilization rate of silicon in polycrystalline silicon production.
The core technology for polycrystalline silicon production is monopolized by the United States, Japan and Germany. In spite of technical development over several years in Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., which started the first large-scale production in China and are still expanding capacity today, their technical level still lags behind foreign giants. 
Aside from these two companies, other projects in China have diversified technology sources and their technical personnel are mostly from the limited pool cultivated by Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. with many years' efforts. There is therefore a considerable risk of technological inadequacies in the smooth completion of these large projects, launched in haste. 
Besides, most of the projects launched in China will produce solar-grade products and target the photovoltaic cell. There will not be many electronic-grade products. Reasons for this are two. One is that enterprises take an unduly optimistic attitude toward the world photovoltaic power generation market. The other is that the technology for making electronic-grade products is not easily available. The reality, however, is that downstream of electronic-grade products is the large-scale IT industry with a great demand whereas the development fever of solar-grade products is mostly based on a demand that is not nearly so firmly established - the still-immature photovoltaic power generation market and a heavy reliance on incentives from various national governments. According to experts including Liu Hanyuan, the new downstream photovoltaic cell projects are more than polycrystalline silicon projects. Like the polycrystalline silicon sector, the capacity expansion of these photovoltaic cell projects is mainly located in China but the target market is mostly in foreign countries. Why is the capacity expansion made by foreign giants that have operated for several dozen years much slower than domestic enterprises? It is uncertain whether the new capacity to make photovoltaic cells can be smoothly digested in China, let alone the polycrystalline silicon capacity. History has shown that new things strongly advocated by governments or industrial circles do not necessarily turn out to be society's choice in the long run. Take one step back - even if photovoltaic power generation proves to be an energy alternative suitable to the national conditions in China, the actual growth of the market demand is yet to be verified. 
Making improvements to polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon manufacturing routes is likely to be the most feasible solution to the raw material supply shortage. In the polycrystalline silicon sector, if the proportion of smelting-process polycrystalline silicon is increased, the consumption of industrial silicon can be reduced and there is no problem of raw material shortage. If the utilization rate of silicon in the Siemens-process polycrystalline silicon production is increased, the industrial silicon supply shortage can also be very well eased. 
Another method is to combine organosilicon with polycrystalline silicon to achieve resource complementation and joint development. Guangzhou GBS High-Tech &amp; Industry Co., Ltd. is going all out to use byproduct silicon tetrachloride in the polycrystalline silicon production to produce gaseous-process silica white. Hydrogen, hydrogen chloride and HSiCl3 separated in the production can be recycled to the process. In this way the pollutant emission is reduced, the economic performance is improved and the bottleneck that has constrained the development of the polycrystalline silicon sector for so many years can also be removed. 
The fundamental way to solve the raw material supply shortage in the polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon production is the vigorous development of organosilicon chemistry. These two products have extensive applications. They are different from each other but come from the same element, silicon. Silicon is one of the most plentiful elements on earth. Its crust abundance is 25.8%, second only to oxygen and much higher than carbon. Silicon dioxide or silicates formed in the natural world can be seen everywhere. If silicon in the earth's crust can be used to directly synthesize organosilicon intermediates or products at a low cost, omitting the industrial silicon smelting that consumes great quantities of resources and power, organosilicon and polycrystalline silicon productions would benefit from inexhaustible low-priced raw material sources, and the development of these two chemical products and related sectors would enter a new era. 


Analysis of the World Trade of Metal Silicon
By kertherine mane ,CNCIC



Ⅰ. World imports

Silicon is a structural and functional material widely used in contemporary high-tech fields and important basic industries. It not only produces the semiconductor-grade polysilicon and optical fiber materials, but also is an indispensable basic raw materials in organic silicon industry. The H.S. Codes (Harmonized System Codes) of the silicon product discussed in this paper is 28046900. Japan, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands are four of the world's largest silicons importing countries. 2006-2007，the annual import amount of the silicons in these countries are more than 100 kiloton, and in 2007 these four countries contributed 58.4 percents of the total imports in the world.
Since 2002, the average unit import price of the silicon has been rising around the world. The price was 1,036 US$/ton in 2002, increased to 1,143 US$/ton in 2003, reached to 1,330 US$/ton in 2004, 1,383 US$/ton in 2005, and kept rising in 2006 when the price is 1,419 US$/ton. As the impact of high oil prices, in the year 2007, the average unit import price of the silicon increased by 25.8 percent of its in 2006, reached 1785 US$/ton.
Japan is the world's largest silicon importing country. Its annual import amount has raised from 189.7 kiloton in 2002 to 252 kiloton in 2007, the average annual growth rate is 5.8%. Since 2003, its annual import amount has been kept over 200 kiloton. China is Japan's largest source of silicon. In 2005, the amount of silicon importing from China to Japan was 85.8% of the total amount of silicon imports in Japan. This ratio increased to 89.2% in 2006, and 91.5% in 2007.
Germany is the world's second-largest silicon importing country. Brazil, Norway, France and the Netherlands are the main original country providing more than 70 percents of the imported silicon for Germany each year. Since 2005, the import volumes from Norway and the Netherlands have decreased, while the import volume from Brazil, France, Canada, Russia and China continue to increase. Imports from China surged from 2 kiloton in 2005 to 14.8 kiloton in 2006.
As the world's third largest importing country of silicon, the import volume of silicon of the United States has reduced in recent years. Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Australia and Norway are the main original country of the silicon for the United States.

Ⅱ. World exports 

South Africa had been the world's largest silicon exporting country. In 2002, South Africa exported 583.9 kiloton silicon, which was 39% of the total world exports. In 2003, its export volume rose to 767.1 kiloton, accounting for 29.7% of the total world exports. Because the silicon plant Ferroatlantica in South Africa stopped production, the export volume of silicon sharply declined from 556.6 kiloton in 2004 to 57.8 kiloton in 2005. In the year 2006 and 2007, the export volume of silicon in South Africa kept below 50 kiloton, only accounting for 4% of the world's total export volume. China used to be the world's second largest exporting country of silicon, in 2005, China has taken the place of the South Africa to be the world's largest silicon exporting country. China's share of the world export of the silicon have been increasing each year, from 25.9% in 2002, 18.5% in 2003, to 51% in 2006 and 53.3% in 2007. Brazil and Norway are two of the most important exporting countries of the silicon in the world, whose annual export volume is more than 140 kiloton.
Since 2003, the world’s average unit price of the exported silicon was only 447 US$/ton and this price almost doubled to 865 US$/ton in 2004. It kept comparatively stable in 2005 and 2006, 1,301 US$/ton and 1,326 US$/ton respectively. Due to the increase of the international energy price, the average unit price of the exported silicon climbed to 1,634 US$/ton in 2007.
China's export volume of the silicon is increasing year by year. In 2002, China exported 387.6 kiloton of the silicon, and in 2007 this figure reached 698.3 kiloton., The average annual growth rate is 12.5% during 2002 ~ 2007. China exports silicon to more than 50 countries and regions in the world. Japan has been China's biggest export destination, taking up 32% of the total export volume of China in recent years. China exports silicon to other countries and regions including Hong Kong, Korea, the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, the Netherlands and Canada.

 
Fig.2  World export market of metal silicon from 2002 to 2007
Brazil’s export volume of the silicon has been comparatively stable, remaining at 180 kiloton to 200 kiloton each year. Brazil has always been a main exporting country of the silicon in the world. In 2005, Brazil became the largest industrial silicon-exporting country, second only to China. Brazil's silicon production mainly exports to the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Britain, France and other western developed countries.
Since 2005, Norway has been the world's third largest silicon exporting country. Its export volume has been comparatively stable since 2002, remaining at 140 kiloton to 180 kiloton each year. Norway's silicon production mainly exports to Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States and other developed western countries.

Green Revolution 
of Silane Coupling Agent Industry

by Liao Jun   General Manager  
       Wuhan University Silicone New Material Co., Ltd.  
( WD SILICONE )

homo's is important raw material of bitch industry, whose structure general formula is HnSi(OR)4-n, where n is 0 or 1 stripper, R is alkyl such as: -CH3、-C2H5、-C3H6 and so on. As to industry, there are four important kinds of silane: methyltrimethoxylsilane (HSi(OCH3)3)and triethoxysilane (HSi(OC2H5)3), tetramethoxysilane (Si(OCH3)4) and tetraethoxy silane (Si(OC2H5)4).
Trialkoxysilane contains both Si-OR band which can be hydrolisis and Si-H which is very active. The structure enables it to be widespreadlly used in the industry, lots of silicon based products can be synthesized from it as raw material, such as large number of carbon functional silicon (mainly be silane coupling agent in industry), the silicone resin, the alkoxy terminated agent and polysilicon which were terminated by the linear polysiloxane et.al. Tetralkoxysilane is also an important silicon intermediate in the industry, it may be used to synthesize halogenate silane or carbon functional silane, synthetic silicone resin and crosslinking silica gel used for the two-group locellus warm curing. It can also be used as the special liquid medium for inorganic parent metal surface protection coating, high pure quartz material, nano silicon dioxide and high reinforcing white carbon by wet method and so on.

Advantage of direct synthetic method processing to product Alkoxyl silane 

 There are many methods to synthesize alkoxyl siliane, and the one to be most commonly used is chlorosilane alcoholysis method in the industrial world. Silicon powder used to make HSiCl3 and SiCl4 at first, and then to react with ROH (CH3OH or C2H5OH), alkoxyl silane can be prepared as soon as the alcoholysis reaction (etherification) began. It needs to introduce and remove chlorine   during the process, which is why this technology can not well admitted when it comes to the environmental protection, energy consumption and cost aspect.
The silicon/alcohol direct synthetic method is to use silicon powder and ROH (is mainly CH3OH and C2H5OH) as raw materials, while using copper as catalyst and reacted in the organic medium, alkoxyl silane can be synthesized in only one step reaction, trialkoxysilan and tetrakloxusilane are also obtained simultaneously. It is relatively simple to form tetrakloxusilane by this way, but what the factories pursue mainly at present is high selectivity of triakyoxysilane, so it is not a wise choice to take the direct synthetic method.
The direct synthetic method has advantages in processing step, resource usage efficiency, the environmental effect and the industrial angle, as we can find the differences between the two methods easily from Fig.2.
First of all, the direct synthetic method has realized one-step synthesis, reduced the process in great degree. Secondly, it needn’t to introduce chlorine during the technological process, thus avoiding problems caused by hydrogen chloride like equipment corrosion and interruption of recycling, and has realized clean production. Thirdly, because the reduction of reactants and no high corrodent existence in the technical process, the impurity content(such as: metal impurities and chloride ion) reduce obviously, the product quality has been greatly enhancement; Fourthly, the process efficiency is high and controllable, and it needn’t to rely on the large-scale chlorosilane installment any more, may facilitate the independent establishment process units. Finally, because the reduction of the reaction steps, efficiency of raw material use and energy raised largely, because reduction of high energy consume silica power, the electric power and charcoal are saved indirectly, and the emissions of greenhouse gas carbon monoxide is reduced as well, what’s more, the production cost is also largely cut.

There is “revolution” as to the silane coupling agent synthesized by direct synthetic method 

In fact, Rochow discovered the direct synthetic method to prepare alkoxyl silane from lower aliphatic alcohol and silicon powder early in 1948, but it didn’t attract enough attentions due to the poor condition at that time. At the end of the 20th century, along with the increasing demand of alkoxyl silane, as well as the great attentions to the resources utilization, the cost and the environment, research and industrial production in direct synthetic method develop fast. Especially in the recent 10 years, large scale production installments to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method have been set up and to be consummated, and expanded gradually.
Momentive Performance Materials (GE silicon at the beginning) established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method in the late-1990s, and its  productivity has achieved ten thousand ton now. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method at the beginning of this century, its productivity is about several thousand tons at present. A new process unit with 10 thousand ton productivity of trialkoxylsilane was begun to build in 2008. 
The main starting points to develop scale manufacture technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane are as follow: 1) to explode cleanly and highly effective processing technology for silicon coupling agent, 2) to provide raw materials with low cost and high quality for silicon coupling agent, 3) to meet the needs of the application of related domains.

Process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：





Process of direct synthetic method：





The silane coupling agent industry is an independent branch in the industry chain of silicon, the dependence to chlorosilane reduces after the successfully development of direct synthetic method. As mentioned above, the direct synthetic method has omitted the raft step which uses chlorosilane and then avoided the corrosion and pollution, result in increasing of resource utilization and high quality products. More importantly, once the technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane in a low cost can be extending scale, the silane coupling agent industry and all related downstream industries which restrained to the problems of cost, supply and environmental protection will get large-scale supply of low cost alkoxyl silane raw material, and their development bottleneck will be broken thoroughly.
The old Witco Corporation of GE silicon (whose service has merged to Momentive Performance Materials) once point out that the direct synthetic method was “a revolutionary process for manufacture of organofunctional silanes”. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd. believed that the successfully explode of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane was the technology revolution of silane coupling agent industry, and to use this new technology was the development tendency of silane coupling agent industry.

Green industrial system and complete industrial chain base on the direct synthetic method building up

1. Promotion and consummation of processing technology 
The direct synthetic method has obvious superiority when compared to the chlorosilane alcoholysis method, but there are still a great number of works to do in order to get mature stable scale processing technology. For example: to further enhance the conversion rate of raw material and the selectivity of trialkoxylsilane, to enhance the controllability and secure of the process and so on. There are processing technology difficulties in 6 aspects: 1. design of chemical reaction process, like reaction condition, catalyst choice, reaction medium choice and so on; 2. process of agitation, including considerations dispersion and reaction kinetics; 3.process of inserting alcohol during the reaction, including the consideration of fast phase transformation; 4. separation processing of trialkoxylsilane and alcohol azeotropy; 5. technology of process amplification effect or scale production; 6. reaction medium processing and cyclic utilization.
Because of many industries have been involved in development of the direct synthetic method process, problems of entire system must be considered carefully and thoroughly as to this method. The key problems are as follow. Firstly, is about the comprehensive utilization of by-products including front cut fraction, middle distillate and high-boiling product, it is mainly about comprehensive utilization of the by-products produced by side reactions fact. Secondly, dual attentions must be given to the development of lower-stream application technology of alkoxyl silane, including the development of synthesis technology of silane coupling agent and the exploitation of other new products, and to ensure the value of industry chain's development from technical angle.
After further consummation of the technology, we believe completely that alkoxyl silane as a monomer will become more and more important in the silicon industry based on the direct synthetic method process which is environment friendly the low cost. The huge and prosperous adownstream derivative industries will be well developed to form an industrial system based on alkoxyl silane produced by direct synthetic method also.
At present, industrial system based on direct synthetic method to produce alkoxyl silane is still in its development initial period, the industrial chain hasn’t been established yet, so its major impact to silicon and the related industry is not that huge as it ought to be. The innovation technology's development and the rapid expansion of scale production of direct synthetic method have already promoted the development value of alkoxyl silane industry largely from the supply and cost, which indicate a bright future for the development of the industry in it industrial chain. To the development of this industrial system, we are willing to work hard together with all the other colleagues!

The Application and Prospects of Silicone Used in Chinese Textile Industry
  by  Ju-Tao Luo  Deputy manager  Zhejiang Transfar Co., Led,



Textile processing region mainly distributed in littoral

China's textile processing region are mainly distributed in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong and other coastal areas. In the past two years, China's printing and dyeing cloth processing volume increasing year by year, as shown in Fig. 1. The total processing amount was 3.62 million ton in 2005, then the amount rose to 4.9 million ton in 2007, the average annual growth rate was about 16.3%. The processing amount of fabric in Zhejiang province was 26.8 billion meter, accounting for 55%. Jiangsu province produced 5.4 billion meter, accounting for 11% of the national total, Shandong province produced 4.6 billion meter, Guangdong province produced 4.3 billion meter, Fujian province produced 30 million meter , as shown in Fig. 2-3.

Fig.3 Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007
China's total output of knitted garments was 10.72 billion in 2007, compared to7.66 billion in 2005, the increased amount was 3.06 billion, with an average annual growth rate of about 18.3 %. the output of Guangdong province whose production of knitted garment ranked first in our country was 2.98 billion, accounting for 27.8 % of total output, followed by Zhejiang’s 2.14 billion (Fig. 4). The Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007 was shown in Fig.5, and the knitted garment production in Shandong province increased faster than any other provinces, with an average annual growth rate of 26.6 %. The knitted garment production in China this year─mainly effected by the textile trade-related policies─was the same as last year. China's total volume of knitted garments was 6.29 billion from January to July in 2008, of which Guangdong province produced 1.68 billion, accounting for 26.7 % of the total (Fig. 6).

Processing variety of different textile centers
As the Chinese textile market growing, textile printing and dyeing of silicone oil consumption increased year by year. The consumption of silicone oil in China's textile printing and dyeing industries was about 38,000 ton in 2007, of which 30 % was supported by imported products, primarily imported from Dow Corning, Momentive, Shin-Etsu and Wacker. The domestic product was about 70 %, which was mainly composed by DMC, D4 and linear compound.
As to different textiles, the requirements of the silicone oil performance vary considerably, for example, chemical fiber requires slippery hand feeling and elastic performance, so the exhaustion  process was used generally. Currently, the amido-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization type) was used mostly, for the cost of the product was low, but its smoothness and elasticity need to be further improved.
The polyester sewing thread and embroidery threads used in yarn must be good at smoothness and sewing performance. And till now they have produced by the general exhaustion  process usually. Dimethyl silicone with good smoothness, low cost advantages was used primarily at present, but it still lack of fastness. Good silicone oil with good smoothness, tailoring and fastness performance should be developed in the future. The wool generally uses amino modified organosilicon softening agent at present (emulsion polymerization), the hand feeling is smooth, and the cost is low, but the product stability is low, and it is easy to be easy to delaminate and oil-disjunk, product with good stability and smooth must be developed in the future. The cotton thread has used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent also at present, which acts charitably smooth, but it was easilyy to cause detwisting and end-breakage. Due to mightness decreasing of treated yarn, most companies use Polythene wax at present.   
The cotton woven fabrics equest more smooth and softer hand feeling than any other fabrics. At present, If there were no requirement for hydrophilicity, amino-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization) would be normally adopted, result in good hand feeling and low cost, but it is easy to cause roller stick. When it comes to those cotton weave fabrics request for hydrophilicity, three kind of softening agents were used, including Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/Amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified Silicone softener. In these way, the cotton weave fabrics were hydrophilicity, no roller stick. After all, hydrophilicity and hand feeling are a pair of contradictory body, when the hydrophilicity are good, hand feeling is bad relatively. Good silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to roller stick and good sliding were still waiting for developing.
The knitted fabrics partly use amino modified organosilicon softening agent (polymerization), and the hand feeling is good, soft and fluffy while the cost is low. But it was suffered from roller stick easily and sticking cylinder easily. The other parts of knitted fabrics use Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and the Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer to match the laminated softening agent. The performance of to be not roller stick and hydrophilicity can choosed according to the demands, but it cost a lot to use these silicone oil, we must develop silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to cause roller stick, with smooth hand feeling and the fluffy, what’s more, the cost must be reduced in the future.
Woven polyester partily used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) with good smoothness and elsatic handfeeling, and its cost was low but easy roller stick. So the developing trend in the future is silicone oil with no roller stick, has good smooth and elastic handfeeling.
Two different types(one features smooth and elastic, the other features bulk) of amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) were choosed to use in T/R generally. It can make the product to have smooth, elastic handfeelingand good bulkness while the cost is low. But the disadvantage is thatApt to roller stick similarly. In addition, silicone oil produced by Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used here. It can conquer the disadvantage of apt to roller stick, while the disadvantage is that it is smoothness, elasticity and bulkness are not enough and high cost. 
The Polyester flocked fabric required the silicon to be soft, smooth, bulk and full handfeeling. And it adopt exhaustion process normally. Silicone oil usually produced by combination with two different kinds of Amino modified silicone softener (one features smooth and elastic, another one features bulk). The advantage is that it has soft and smooth handfeeling, good bulkness and low cost. And the disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick. Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used to prepare silicon oil. It is no roller stick, but lack of smoothness, bulkness, and the cost is high too.
Nylon required silicon oil to be soft and smooth handfeeling. Padding process was adopted normally. Silicone oil a form by amino modified silicone softener（bulk polymerization）was used primarily, which  owns advantage of soft and smooth handfeeling and low cost. The     disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick and the softness is not enough. When Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer were used,  the result is the it is no roller stick any more, but the disadvantage is that the softness is not enough.
As to flax, if it had no requirement for hydrophilicity, and amino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）was used to get smooth handfeeling and low cost while suffered from aptting to cause roller stick. If it had requirement for hydrophilicity, Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified silicone softener were used to obtain advantages of hydrophilicity and no roller stick but bad handfeeling relatively.
Woolen fabric required smooth and bulk handfeeling. Exhaustion process was adopted normally at present. The silicone oil used was formed by mino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）,whose advantages were good smoothness and low cost, but with disadvantages of unstable, apt to cause dilamination and oil-disjunktion. So the developing trend of silicone oil is  to produce silicon oil with good stability and smoothness to meet the requirement of the development of cowboy, cotton and kapok leisure clothing.

Silicone oil used for functional class processing applied will receive favors
The demand of silicone oil used in spinning and weaving in 2007 in our country was approximately 38,000 ton. It will increase quitely in the next everal years, especially to ready-made clothing which will grow fasfest, followed by the yarn next, and the knitting will occupy third, the weave occupies fourth.
 
Fig.7 Consumption potential (anticipating for increasing space)

Along with the diversification of textile, the demand of functionalization and high added value's silicone oil will increase. For example, the silicon oil to be used together with the hydrophilic composite in one-bath which can not effect the hydrophilic and good hand feeling were in greatly need. Silicon oil to be used together with the burning inhibitor in one-bath while the performances of flame-resistant and good hand feeling can’t be reduced were also needed. We also need silicon oil to be used togerther with the antistatic agent in one-bath to keep an anti-static electricity performance. To sum up, the great requirement of silicon to be used together with the hydrophilic, flame-resistant, soft, the anti-static electricity composites in one-bath, then fabric can be endowed with many kinds of functions as shown above. What’s more, if it was used together with the fixing agent in one-bath, their properties such as the hand feeling and color fastness can’t be affected.
The unceasingly pursue of the textile’s good performance will promote the silicone oil’s functionality. For example, silicon oil which can be used together with the dyeing in one-bath, silicon oil with super chemical stability which can be used used in jet machine, cotton-used silicone oil has cool hand feeling, new product can increase handfeeling and wet rubbing fastness. Silicone base color deepening agent, it can impart fabric with excellent color deepening effect. Stock stability is good. No effect to color fastness and good hand feeling.
The requirement for expanding application field of silicon product's will be further developed. Such as: silicone glue used in printing, silicone used in coating, silicone rubber which is compatible with printing and coating chemicals, silicone combined with polyurther to be used in coating, silicone combined with acrylic acid to be used in printing, silicone combined with fluocarbon to be used in water proof and so on.
As the rise of raw material's cost, the international pressure of the textile industry increases day by day. The textile of our country will trend to use functional and upscale silicone oil. What’s more, the environmental protection and energy conservation will also promote the silicone oil to be greener and more environmentally friendly.

Polycrystalline Silicon – What to Do?

By Bai Hongqiang, China National Chemical Information Center



1. Upsurge of polycrystalline silicon

Polycrystalline silicon is a basic material with extensive applications in the electronics and solar photovoltaic sectors. It was not very well known in the past. In the development of alternative energies triggered by the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; solar cell manufacturers have expanded capacity and their demand for polycrystalline silicon has grown rapidly. A serious supply shortage of polycrystalline silicon has developed all over the world. Despite full-capacity operation in most existing polycrystalline silicon units, the market demand can hardly be satisfied. The price of polycrystalline silicon has increased constantly, exceeding US$400 per kg at the end of 2007. The rising price has generated fat profits for producers. According to an annual performance statement published by a domestic polycrystalline silicon producer with a capacity of 50 t/a, the target of accomplishing a profit of RMB100 million in 2007 was attained in October 2007. 
Stimulated by fat profits, domestic polycrystalline silicon producers have expanded their capacities at an astonishing rate. The new capacity in China will reach 160 000-190 000 t/a in the next few years. More than 30 construction projects are planned, and most of them will start production around 2010. 
&quot;The growth of the photovoltaic sector is a dangerous thing,&quot; pointed out a report on the sector in 2007 prepared by a securities research institute. Although experts have constantly adjusted their forecasts upward, they always underestimate the demand growth in the market. 
It should be noted that government forces are also involved in this tide and have become one of the major features in this investment fever. According to statistics, governments of nearly 20 provinces and municipalities have already regarded the photovoltaic sector as the focus in the development of new sectors and the transformation of old sectors. They are all planning to launch polycrystalline silicon projects. 

2. Questions in the development of polycrystalline silicon

The major sector driving the growth of polycrystalline silicon market is the solar cell sector. Quality requirements for polycrystalline silicon used in electronics such as semiconductors are much higher than for solar-grade. Even for the solar-grade varieties, the production using smelting and purification are very difficult. The mainstream process for the production of polycrystalline silicon used today is the chemical method. The modified Siemens process (also called the HSiCl3 process) is the most popular. Comparatively speaking, the ASiMI process (the SiH4 process) and the granular polycrystalline silicon manufacturing technology and smelting process are not often used. 
The Siemens process uses HSiCl3 as raw material and consumes a great deal of material and energy. It has considerable impact on the indirect-process silane coupling agent sector, which also uses HSiCl3 as raw material. No matter what method is used, polycrystalline silicon production consumes great quantities of industrial silicon as the starting material. There is therefore a huge potential impact on the organosilicon sector, which also uses industrial silicon as raw material. 
Take the modified Siemens process for instance. Producing one ton of polycrystalline silicon needs around 10 tons of HSiCl3 (equivalent to 3.5 tons of industrial silicon). According to the estimates made by China Electronics Materials Industry Association, the output of polycrystalline silicon in China will reach around 3 000 tons in 2008, the consumption of HSiCl3 in the polycrystalline silicon sector will be around 30 000 tons and the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be around 10 000 tons. 
The output of industrial silicon in China is around 700 000 tons today. Two thirds of the output is exported. The remaining one third is used in the domestic market. Around 60% of it is used in organosilicon production and the balance is used in alloy casting. The organosilicon sector is developing rapidly today. It is expected that the capacity to make organosilicon monomer will reach around 1.80 million t/a in 2010 and the consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by more than 450 000 tons.
If one third (around 60 000 t/a) of polycrystalline silicon projects planned for construction and expansion start production in 2010 and all of them use the Siemens process, the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by around 200 000 tons. When the difference in the technical level of these units is considered, the actual consumption will likely be higher. 
Something can already been seen from the market price trend of HSiCl3 in the past year or so. The price of HSiCl3 that was only an intermediate product and had small circulation in the silane coupling agent sector is still increasing dramatically today. By early March 2008 it rose to RMB19 000 per ton, more than doubling the price in just one year, and there are no signs whatsoever of the price going down. Besides the cost increase caused by the price rise of industrial silicon, the sudden entrance of polycrystalline silicon producers into the market as buyers is also an important reason for the skyrocketing price rise. Although most polycrystalline silicon producers have their own raw material units and hence do not purchase much HSiCl3, sales of HSiCl3 have still increased remarkably in recent years due to the great number of projects and buyers. 
Silane coupling agent producers using the indirect process are faced with a dilemma. They can achieve raw material self-sufficiency through purchasing industrial silicon themselves and protect themselves from the supply shortage and price rise of HSiCl3, but the price of industrial silicon has already grown rapidly, other costs are also on the increase, the competition in the downstream market has become fierce and it is harder to assure profits. In case the margin is further narrowed and the price of HSiCl3 increases further, how should silane coupling agent producers readjust their business? Should they make the direct sales of HSiCl3 to get profits or should they increase the price of products or improve the process to better their operation? 
In a not too distant future, the impacts of the drastic capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon on organosilicon enterprises will perhaps appear along with a competition for raw material industrial silicon. If the consumption of industrial silicon for polycrystalline silicon reaches 200 000 tons in 2010, its proportion of the total demand of industrial silicon will be around a quarter. The demand for industrial silicon in the organosilicon and alloy sectors will also increase drastically during that period. If the growth in the supply of industrial silicon slows down, polycrystalline silicon producers that have a strong financial standing will surely buy at high prices to ensure their own raw material supply. Some organosilicon enterprises that have made no breakthroughs in their high-end downstream consumption sectors and large-scale production technologies will very likely find themselves in a predicament in the next few years. 
It may not be possible to relieve the raw material shortage through rapid growth of the industrial silicon supply. Because production of industrial silicon is energy intensive, output in advanced countries has already shrunk greatly. China will no longer grant incentives for its production either, as evidenced by the readjustment to the export rebate and the export tariff policy and the elimination of the differential power price since early 2005. In such a scenario there is slim possibility of doubling the output of industrial silicon in China within three years to meet the domestic demand. 

3. Technical innovation: the best solution to raw material shortage

The negative impact of polycrystalline silicon production on the organosilicon sector is mainly reflected in the competition for raw material. That impact can be reduced in three cases. The first is that the total capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon turns out to be less than has been forecast. The second is that the supply of industrial silicon grows rapidly, but that prospect is already proved to be improbable. The third is that a new technical route is opened up, bypassing industrial silicon in producing either organosilicon or polycrystalline silicon, or remarkably increasing the utilization rate of silicon in polycrystalline silicon production.
The core technology for polycrystalline silicon production is monopolized by the United States, Japan and Germany. In spite of technical development over several years in Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., which started the first large-scale production in China and are still expanding capacity today, their technical level still lags behind foreign giants. 
Aside from these two companies, other projects in China have diversified technology sources and their technical personnel are mostly from the limited pool cultivated by Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. with many years' efforts. There is therefore a considerable risk of technological inadequacies in the smooth completion of these large projects, launched in haste. 
Besides, most of the projects launched in China will produce solar-grade products and target the photovoltaic cell. There will not be many electronic-grade products. Reasons for this are two. One is that enterprises take an unduly optimistic attitude toward the world photovoltaic power generation market. The other is that the technology for making electronic-grade products is not easily available. The reality, however, is that downstream of electronic-grade products is the large-scale IT industry with a great demand whereas the development fever of solar-grade products is mostly based on a demand that is not nearly so firmly established - the still-immature photovoltaic power generation market and a heavy reliance on incentives from various national governments. According to experts including Liu Hanyuan, the new downstream photovoltaic cell projects are more than polycrystalline silicon projects. Like the polycrystalline silicon sector, the capacity expansion of these photovoltaic cell projects is mainly located in China but the target market is mostly in foreign countries. Why is the capacity expansion made by foreign giants that have operated for several dozen years much slower than domestic enterprises? It is uncertain whether the new capacity to make photovoltaic cells can be smoothly digested in China, let alone the polycrystalline silicon capacity. History has shown that new things strongly advocated by governments or industrial circles do not necessarily turn out to be society's choice in the long run. Take one step back - even if photovoltaic power generation proves to be an energy alternative suitable to the national conditions in China, the actual growth of the market demand is yet to be verified. 
Making improvements to polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon manufacturing routes is likely to be the most feasible solution to the raw material supply shortage. In the polycrystalline silicon sector, if the proportion of smelting-process polycrystalline silicon is increased, the consumption of industrial silicon can be reduced and there is no problem of raw material shortage. If the utilization rate of silicon in the Siemens-process polycrystalline silicon production is increased, the industrial silicon supply shortage can also be very well eased. 
Another method is to combine organosilicon with polycrystalline silicon to achieve resource complementation and joint development. Guangzhou GBS High-Tech &amp; Industry Co., Ltd. is going all out to use byproduct silicon tetrachloride in the polycrystalline silicon production to produce gaseous-process silica white. Hydrogen, hydrogen chloride and HSiCl3 separated in the production can be recycled to the process. In this way the pollutant emission is reduced, the economic performance is improved and the bottleneck that has constrained the development of the polycrystalline silicon sector for so many years can also be removed. 
The fundamental way to solve the raw material supply shortage in the polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon production is the vigorous development of organosilicon chemistry. These two products have extensive applications. They are different from each other but come from the same element, silicon. Silicon is one of the most plentiful elements on earth. Its crust abundance is 25.8%, second only to oxygen and much higher than carbon. Silicon dioxide or silicates formed in the natural world can be seen everywhere. If silicon in the earth's crust can be used to directly synthesize organosilicon intermediates or products at a low cost, omitting the industrial silicon smelting that consumes great quantities of resources and power, organosilicon and polycrystalline silicon productions would benefit from inexhaustible low-priced raw material sources, and the development of these two chemical products and related sectors would enter a new era. 


Analysis of the World Trade of Metal Silicon
By kertherine mane ,CNCIC



Ⅰ. World imports

Silicon is a structural and functional material widely used in contemporary high-tech fields and important basic industries. It not only produces the semiconductor-grade polysilicon and optical fiber materials, but also is an indispensable basic raw materials in organic silicon industry. The H.S. Codes (Harmonized System Codes) of the silicon product discussed in this paper is 28046900. Japan, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands are four of the world's largest silicons importing countries. 2006-2007，the annual import amount of the silicons in these countries are more than 100 kiloton, and in 2007 these four countries contributed 58.4 percents of the total imports in the world.
Since 2002, the average unit import price of the silicon has been rising around the world. The price was 1,036 US$/ton in 2002, increased to 1,143 US$/ton in 2003, reached to 1,330 US$/ton in 2004, 1,383 US$/ton in 2005, and kept rising in 2006 when the price is 1,419 US$/ton. As the impact of high oil prices, in the year 2007, the average unit import price of the silicon increased by 25.8 percent of its in 2006, reached 1785 US$/ton.
Japan is the world's largest silicon importing country. Its annual import amount has raised from 189.7 kiloton in 2002 to 252 kiloton in 2007, the average annual growth rate is 5.8%. Since 2003, its annual import amount has been kept over 200 kiloton. China is Japan's largest source of silicon. In 2005, the amount of silicon importing from China to Japan was 85.8% of the total amount of silicon imports in Japan. This ratio increased to 89.2% in 2006, and 91.5% in 2007.
Germany is the world's second-largest silicon importing country. Brazil, Norway, France and the Netherlands are the main original country providing more than 70 percents of the imported silicon for Germany each year. Since 2005, the import volumes from Norway and the Netherlands have decreased, while the import volume from Brazil, France, Canada, Russia and China continue to increase. Imports from China surged from 2 kiloton in 2005 to 14.8 kiloton in 2006.
As the world's third largest importing country of silicon, the import volume of silicon of the United States has reduced in recent years. Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Australia and Norway are the main original country of the silicon for the United States.

Ⅱ. World exports 

South Africa had been the world's largest silicon exporting country. In 2002, South Africa exported 583.9 kiloton silicon, which was 39% of the total world exports. In 2003, its export volume rose to 767.1 kiloton, accounting for 29.7% of the total world exports. Because the silicon plant Ferroatlantica in South Africa stopped production, the export volume of silicon sharply declined from 556.6 kiloton in 2004 to 57.8 kiloton in 2005. In the year 2006 and 2007, the export volume of silicon in South Africa kept below 50 kiloton, only accounting for 4% of the world's total export volume. China used to be the world's second largest exporting country of silicon, in 2005, China has taken the place of the South Africa to be the world's largest silicon exporting country. China's share of the world export of the silicon have been increasing each year, from 25.9% in 2002, 18.5% in 2003, to 51% in 2006 and 53.3% in 2007. Brazil and Norway are two of the most important exporting countries of the silicon in the world, whose annual export volume is more than 140 kiloton.
Since 2003, the world’s average unit price of the exported silicon was only 447 US$/ton and this price almost doubled to 865 US$/ton in 2004. It kept comparatively stable in 2005 and 2006, 1,301 US$/ton and 1,326 US$/ton respectively. Due to the increase of the international energy price, the average unit price of the exported silicon climbed to 1,634 US$/ton in 2007.
China's export volume of the silicon is increasing year by year. In 2002, China exported 387.6 kiloton of the silicon, and in 2007 this figure reached 698.3 kiloton., The average annual growth rate is 12.5% during 2002 ~ 2007. China exports silicon to more than 50 countries and regions in the world. Japan has been China's biggest export destination, taking up 32% of the total export volume of China in recent years. China exports silicon to other countries and regions including Hong Kong, Korea, the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, the Netherlands and Canada.

 
Fig.2  World export market of metal silicon from 2002 to 2007
Brazil’s export volume of the silicon has been comparatively stable, remaining at 180 kiloton to 200 kiloton each year. Brazil has always been a main exporting country of the silicon in the world. In 2005, Brazil became the largest industrial silicon-exporting country, second only to China. Brazil's silicon production mainly exports to the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Britain, France and other western developed countries.
Since 2005, Norway has been the world's third largest silicon exporting country. Its export volume has been comparatively stable since 2002, remaining at 140 kiloton to 180 kiloton each year. Norway's silicon production mainly exports to Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States and other developed western countries.

Green Revolution 
of Silane Coupling Agent Industry

by Liao Jun   General Manager  
       Wuhan University Silicone New Material Co., Ltd.  
( WD SILICONE )


Alkoxyl silane is important raw material of silicone industry, whose structure general formula is HnSi(OR)4-n, where n is 0 or 1, R is alkyl such as: -CH3、-C2H5、-C3H6 and so on. As to industry, there are four important kinds of silane: methyltrimethoxylsilane (HSi(OCH3)3)and triethoxysilane (HSi(OC2H5)3), tetramethoxysilane (Si(OCH3)4) and tetraethoxy silane (Si(OC2H5)4).
Trialkoxysilane contains both Si-OR band which can be hydrolisis and Si-H which is very active. The structure enables it to be widespreadlly used in the industry, lots of silicon based products can be synthesized from it as raw material, such as large number of carbon functional silicon (mainly be silane coupling agent in industry), the silicone resin, the alkoxy terminated agent and polysilicon which were terminated by the linear polysiloxane et.al. Tetralkoxysilane is also an important silicon intermediate in the industry, it may be used to synthesize halogenate silane or carbon functional silane, synthetic silicone resin and crosslinking silica gel used for the two-group locellus warm curing. It can also be used as the special liquid medium for inorganic parent metal surface protection coating, high pure quartz material, nano silicon dioxide and high reinforcing white carbon by wet method and so on.

Advantage of direct synthetic method processing to product Alkoxyl silane 

 There are many methods to synthesize alkoxyl siliane, and the one to be most commonly used is chlorosilane alcoholysis method in the industrial world. Silicon powder used to make HSiCl3 and SiCl4 at first, and then to react with ROH (CH3OH or C2H5OH), alkoxyl silane can be prepared as soon as the alcoholysis reaction (etherification) began. It needs to introduce and remove chlorine   during the process, which is why this technology can not well admitted when it comes to the environmental protection, energy consumption and cost aspect.
The silicon/alcohol direct synthetic method is to use silicon powder and ROH (is mainly CH3OH and C2H5OH) as raw materials, while using copper as catalyst and reacted in the organic medium, alkoxyl silane can be synthesized in only one step reaction, trialkoxysilan and tetrakloxusilane are also obtained simultaneously. It is relatively simple to form tetrakloxusilane by this way, but what the factories pursue mainly at present is high selectivity of triakyoxysilane, so it is not a wise choice to take the direct synthetic method.
The direct synthetic method has advantages in processing step, resource usage efficiency, the environmental effect and the industrial angle, as we can find the differences between the two methods easily from Fig.2.
First of all, the direct synthetic method has realized one-step synthesis, reduced the process in great degree. Secondly, it needn’t to introduce chlorine during the technological process, thus avoiding problems caused by hydrogen chloride like equipment corrosion and interruption of recycling, and has realized clean production. Thirdly, because the reduction of reactants and no high corrodent existence in the technical process, the impurity content(such as: metal impurities and chloride ion) reduce obviously, the product quality has been greatly enhancement; Fourthly, the process efficiency is high and controllable, and it needn’t to rely on the large-scale chlorosilane installment any more, may facilitate the independent establishment process units. Finally, because the reduction of the reaction steps, efficiency of raw material use and energy raised largely, because reduction of high energy consume silica power, the electric power and charcoal are saved indirectly, and the emissions of greenhouse gas carbon monoxide is reduced as well, what’s more, the production cost is also largely cut.

Fig.1 Compare of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method
The reactions of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：
1)trialkoxysilane：
HSiCl3 + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
        HSi(OR)2Cl + ROH  → ClSi(OR)3 + H2
        HSi(OR)3 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O → polymer ＋ HCl
2)tetrakloxysilane：
SiCl4 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        Si(OR)4 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O →polymer ＋ HCl
The reactions of direct synthetic method:
Si + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 + H2
HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
Side reaction：ROH + Si → RSiH(OR)2 + RSi(OR)3 + H2O + H2
        HSi(OR)3 or Si(OR)4  + H2O → ≡SiOSi≡polymer ＋ ROH 
        HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 → polymer＋ H2O

There is “revolution” as to the silane coupling agent synthesized by direct synthetic method 

In fact, Rochow discovered the direct synthetic method to prepare alkoxyl silane from lower aliphatic alcohol and silicon powder early in 1948, but it didn’t attract enough attentions due to the poor condition at that time. At the end of the 20th century, along with the increasing demand of alkoxyl silane, as well as the great attentions to the resources utilization, the cost and the environment, research and industrial production in direct synthetic method develop fast. Especially in the recent 10 years, large scale production installments to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method have been set up and to be consummated, and expanded gradually.
Momentive Performance Materials (GE silicon at the beginning) established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method in the late-1990s, and its  productivity has achieved ten thousand ton now. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method at the beginning of this century, its productivity is about several thousand tons at present. A new process unit with 10 thousand ton productivity of trialkoxylsilane was begun to build in 2008. 
The main starting points to develop scale manufacture technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane are as follow: 1) to explode cleanly and highly effective processing technology for silicon coupling agent, 2) to provide raw materials with low cost and high quality for silicon coupling agent, 3) to meet the needs of the application of related domains.

Fig.2 Compare of the process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method

Process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：





Process of direct synthetic method：





The silane coupling agent industry is an independent branch in the industry chain of silicon, the dependence to chlorosilane reduces after the successfully development of direct synthetic method. As mentioned above, the direct synthetic method has omitted the raft step which uses chlorosilane and then avoided the corrosion and pollution, result in increasing of resource utilization and high quality products. More importantly, once the technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane in a low cost can be extending scale, the silane coupling agent industry and all related downstream industries which restrained to the problems of cost, supply and environmental protection will get large-scale supply of low cost alkoxyl silane raw material, and their development bottleneck will be broken thoroughly.
The old Witco Corporation of GE silicon (whose service has merged to Momentive Performance Materials) once point out that the direct synthetic method was “a revolutionary process for manufacture of organofunctional silanes”. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd. believed that the successfully explode of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane was the technology revolution of silane coupling agent industry, and to use this new technology was the development tendency of silane coupling agent industry.

Green industrial system and complete industrial chain base on the direct synthetic method building up

1. Promotion and consummation of processing technology 
The direct synthetic method has obvious superiority when compared to the chlorosilane alcoholysis method, but there are still a great number of works to do in order to get mature stable scale processing technology. For example: to further enhance the conversion rate of raw material and the selectivity of trialkoxylsilane, to enhance the controllability and secure of the process and so on. There are processing technology difficulties in 6 aspects: 1. design of chemical reaction process, like reaction condition, catalyst choice, reaction medium choice and so on; 2. process of agitation, including considerations dispersion and reaction kinetics; 3.process of inserting alcohol during the reaction, including the consideration of fast phase transformation; 4. separation processing of trialkoxylsilane and alcohol azeotropy; 5. technology of process amplification effect or scale production; 6. reaction medium processing and cyclic utilization.
Because of many industries have been involved in development of the direct synthetic method process, problems of entire system must be considered carefully and thoroughly as to this method. The key problems are as follow. Firstly, is about the comprehensive utilization of by-products including front cut fraction, middle distillate and high-boiling product, it is mainly about comprehensive utilization of the by-products produced by side reactions fact. Secondly, dual attentions must be given to the development of lower-stream application technology of alkoxyl silane, including the development of synthesis technology of silane coupling agent and the exploitation of other new products, and to ensure the value of industry chain's development from technical angle.
After further consummation of the technology, we believe completely that alkoxyl silane as a monomer will become more and more important in the silicon industry based on the direct synthetic method process which is environment friendly the low cost. The huge and prosperous adownstream derivative industries will be well developed to form an industrial system based on alkoxyl silane produced by direct synthetic method also.
At present, industrial system based on direct synthetic method to produce alkoxyl silane is still in its development initial period, the industrial chain hasn’t been established yet, so its major impact to silicon and the related industry is not that huge as it ought to be. The innovation technology's development and the rapid expansion of scale production of direct synthetic method have already promoted the development value of alkoxyl silane industry largely from the supply and cost, which indicate a bright future for the development of the industry in it industrial chain. To the development of this industrial system, we are willing to work hard together with all the other colleagues!

Textile processing region mainly distributed in littoral

China's textile processing region are mainly distributed in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong and other coastal areas. In the past two years, China's printing and dyeing cloth processing volume increasing year by year, as shown in Fig. 1. The total processing amount was 3.62 million ton in 2005, then the amount rose to 4.9 million ton in 2007, the average annual growth rate was about 16.3%. The processing amount of fabric in Zhejiang province was 26.8 billion meter, accounting for 55%. Jiangsu province produced 5.4 billion meter, accounting for 11% of the national total, Shandong province produced 4.6 billion meter, Guangdong province produced 4.3 billion meter, Fujian province produced 30 million meter , as shown in Fig. 2-3.

China's total output of knitted garments was 10.72 billion in 2007, compared to7.66 billion in 2005, the increased amount was 3.06 billion, with an average annual growth rate of about 18.3 %. the output of Guangdong province whose production of knitted garment ranked first in our country was 2.98 billion, accounting for 27.8 % of total output, followed by Zhejiang’s 2.14 billion (Fig. 4). The Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007 was shown in Fig.5, and the knitted garment production in Shandong province increased faster than any other provinces, with an average annual growth rate of 26.6 %. The knitted garment production in China this year─mainly effected by the textile trade-related policies─was the same as last year. China's total volume of knitted garments was 6.29 billion from January to July in 2008, of which Guangdong province produced 1.68 billion, accounting for 26.7 % of the total (Fig. 6).

Processing variety of different textile centers
As the Chinese textile market growing, textile printing and dyeing of silicone oil consumption increased year by year. The consumption of silicone oil in China's textile printing and dyeing industries was about 38,000 ton in 2007, of which 30 % was supported by imported products, primarily imported from Dow Corning, Momentive, Shin-Etsu and Wacker. The domestic product was about 70 %, which was mainly composed by DMC, D4 and linear compound.
As to different textiles, the requirements of the silicone oil performance vary considerably, for example, chemical fiber requires slippery hand feeling and elastic performance, so the exhaustion  process was used generally. Currently, the amido-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization type) was used mostly, for the cost of the product was low, but its smoothness and elasticity need to be further improved.
The polyester sewing thread and embroidery threads used in yarn must be good at smoothness and sewing performance. And till now they have produced by the general exhaustion  process usually. Dimethyl silicone with good smoothness, low cost advantages was used primarily at present, but it still lack of fastness. Good silicone oil with good smoothness, tailoring and fastness performance should be developed in the future. The wool generally uses amino modified organosilicon softening agent at present (emulsion polymerization), the hand feeling is smooth, and the cost is low, but the product stability is low, and it is easy to be easy to delaminate and oil-disjunk, product with good stability and smooth must be developed in the future. The cotton thread has used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent also at present, which acts charitably smooth, but it was easilyy to cause detwisting and end-breakage. Due to mightness decreasing of treated yarn, most companies use Polythene wax at present.   
The cotton woven fabrics equest more smooth and softer hand feeling than any other fabrics. At present, If there were no requirement for hydrophilicity, amino-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization) would be normally adopted, result in good hand feeling and low cost, but it is easy to cause roller stick. When it comes to those cotton weave fabrics request for hydrophilicity, three kind of softening agents were used, including Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/Amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified Silicone softener. In these way, the cotton weave fabrics were hydrophilicity, no roller stick. After all, hydrophilicity and hand feeling are a pair of contradictory body, when the hydrophilicity are good, hand feeling is bad relatively. Good silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to roller stick and good sliding were still waiting for developing.
The knitted fabrics partly use amino modified organosilicon softening agent (polymerization), and the hand feeling is good, soft and fluffy while the cost is low. But it was suffered from roller stick easily and sticking cylinder easily. The other parts of knitted fabrics use Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and the Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer to match the laminated softening agent. The performance of to be not roller stick and hydrophilicity can choosed according to the demands, but it cost a lot to use these silicone oil, we must develop silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to cause roller stick, with smooth hand feeling and the fluffy, what’s more, the cost must be reduced in the future.
Woven polyester partily used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) with good smoothness and elsatic handfeeling, and its cost was low but easy roller stick. So the developing trend in the future is silicone oil with no roller stick, has good smooth and elastic handfeeling.
Two different types(one features smooth and elastic, the other features bulk) of amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) were choosed to use in T/R generally. It can make the product to have smooth, elastic handfeelingand good bulkness while the cost is low. But the disadvantage is thatApt to roller stick similarly. In addition, silicone oil produced by Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used here. It can conquer the disadvantage of apt to roller stick, while the disadvantage is that it is smoothness, elasticity and bulkness are not enough and high cost. 
The Polyester flocked fabric required the silicon to be soft, smooth, bulk and full handfeeling. And it adopt exhaustion process normally. Silicone oil usually produced by combination with two different kinds of Amino modified silicone softener (one features smooth and elastic, another one features bulk). The advantage is that it has soft and smooth handfeeling, good bulkness and low cost. And the disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick. Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used to prepare silicon oil. It is no roller stick, but lack of smoothness, bulkness, and the cost is high too.
Nylon required silicon oil to be soft and smooth handfeeling. Padding process was adopted normally. Silicone oil a form by amino modified silicone softener（bulk polymerization）was used primarily, which  owns advantage of soft and smooth handfeeling and low cost. The     disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick and the softness is not enough. When Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer were used,  the result is the it is no roller stick any more, but the disadvantage is that the softness is not enough.
As to flax, if it had no requirement for hydrophilicity, and amino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）was used to get smooth handfeeling and low cost while suffered from aptting to cause roller stick. If it had requirement for hydrophilicity, Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified silicone softener were used to obtain advantages of hydrophilicity and no roller stick but bad handfeeling relatively.
Woolen fabric required smooth and bulk handfeeling. Exhaustion process was adopted normally at present. The silicone oil used was formed by mino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）,whose advantages were good smoothness and low cost, but with disadvantages of unstable, apt to cause dilamination and oil-disjunktion. So the developing trend of silicone oil is  to produce silicon oil with good stability and smoothness to meet the requirement of the development of cowboy, cotton and kapok leisure clothing.

Silicone oil used for functional class processing applied will receive favors
The demand of silicone oil used in spinning and weaving in 2007 in our country was approximately 38,000 ton. It will increase quitely in the next everal years, especially to ready-made clothing which will grow fasfest, followed by the yarn next, and the knitting will occupy third, the weave occupies fourth.
 
Fig.7 Consumption potential (anticipating for increasing space)

Along with the diversification of textile, the demand of functionalization and high added value's silicone oil will increase. For example, the silicon oil to be used together with the hydrophilic composite in one-bath which can not effect the hydrophilic and good hand feeling were in greatly need. Silicon oil to be used together with the burning inhibitor in one-bath while the performances of flame-resistant and good hand feeling can’t be reduced were also needed. We also need silicon oil to be used togerther with the antistatic agent in one-bath to keep an anti-static electricity performance. To sum up, the great requirement of silicon to be used together with the hydrophilic, flame-resistant, soft, the anti-static electricity composites in one-bath, then fabric can be endowed with many kinds of functions as shown above. What’s more, if it was used together with the fixing agent in one-bath, their properties such as the hand feeling and color fastness can’t be affected.
The unceasingly pursue of the textile’s good performance will promote the silicone oil’s functionality. For example, silicon oil which can be used together with the dyeing in one-bath, silicon oil with super chemical stability which can be used used in jet machine, cotton-used silicone oil has cool hand feeling, new product can increase handfeeling and wet rubbing fastness. Silicone base color deepening agent, it can impart fabric with excellent color deepening effect. Stock stability is good. No effect to color fastness and good hand feeling.
The requirement for expanding application field of silicon product's will be further developed. Such as: silicone glue used in printing, silicone used in coating, silicone rubber which is compatible with printing and coating chemicals, silicone combined with polyurther to be used in coating, silicone combined with acrylic acid to be used in printing, silicone combined with fluocarbon to be used in water proof and so on.
As the rise of raw material's cost, the international pressure of the textile industry increases day by day. The textile of our country will trend to use functional and upscale silicone oil. What’s more, the environmental protection and energy conservation will also promote the silicone oil to be greener and more environmentally friendly.

Polycrystalline Silicon – What to Do?

By Bai Hongqiang, China National Chemical Information Center



1. Upsurge of polycrystalline silicon

Polycrystalline silicon is a basic material with extensive applications in the electronics and solar photovoltaic sectors. It was not very well known in the past. In the development of alternative energies triggered by the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; solar cell manufacturers have expanded capacity and their demand for polycrystalline silicon has grown rapidly. A serious supply shortage of polycrystalline silicon has developed all over the world. Despite full-capacity operation in most existing polycrystalline silicon units, the market demand can hardly be satisfied. The price of polycrystalline silicon has increased constantly, exceeding US$400 per kg at the end of 2007. The rising price has generated fat profits for producers. According to an annual performance statement published by a domestic polycrystalline silicon producer with a capacity of 50 t/a, the target of accomplishing a profit of RMB100 million in 2007 was attained in October 2007. 
Stimulated by fat profits, domestic polycrystalline silicon producers have expanded their capacities at an astonishing rate. The new capacity in China will reach 160 000-190 000 t/a in the next few years. More than 30 construction projects are planned, and most of them will start production around 2010. 
&quot;The growth of the photovoltaic sector is a dangerous thing,&quot; pointed out a report on the sector in 2007 prepared by a securities research institute. Although experts have constantly adjusted their forecasts upward, they always underestimate the demand growth in the market. 
It should be noted that government forces are also involved in this tide and have become one of the major features in this investment fever. According to statistics, governments of nearly 20 provinces and municipalities have already regarded the photovoltaic sector as the focus in the development of new sectors and the transformation of old sectors. They are all planning to launch polycrystalline silicon projects. 

2. Questions in the development of polycrystalline silicon

The major sector driving the growth of polycrystalline silicon market is the solar cell sector. Quality requirements for polycrystalline silicon used in electronics such as semiconductors are much higher than for solar-grade. Even for the solar-grade varieties, the production using smelting and purification are very difficult. The mainstream process for the production of polycrystalline silicon used today is the chemical method. The modified Siemens process (also called the HSiCl3 process) is the most popular. Comparatively speaking, the ASiMI process (the SiH4 process) and the granular polycrystalline silicon manufacturing technology and smelting process are not often used. 
The Siemens process uses HSiCl3 as raw material and consumes a great deal of material and energy. It has considerable impact on the indirect-process silane coupling agent sector, which also uses HSiCl3 as raw material. No matter what method is used, polycrystalline silicon production consumes great quantities of industrial silicon as the starting material. There is therefore a huge potential impact on the organosilicon sector, which also uses industrial silicon as raw material. 
Take the modified Siemens process for instance. Producing one ton of polycrystalline silicon needs around 10 tons of HSiCl3 (equivalent to 3.5 tons of industrial silicon). According to the estimates made by China Electronics Materials Industry Association, the output of polycrystalline silicon in China will reach around 3 000 tons in 2008, the consumption of HSiCl3 in the polycrystalline silicon sector will be around 30 000 tons and the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be around 10 000 tons. 
The output of industrial silicon in China is around 700 000 tons today. Two thirds of the output is exported. The remaining one third is used in the domestic market. Around 60% of it is used in organosilicon production and the balance is used in alloy casting. The organosilicon sector is developing rapidly today. It is expected that the capacity to make organosilicon monomer will reach around 1.80 million t/a in 2010 and the consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by more than 450 000 tons.
If one third (around 60 000 t/a) of polycrystalline silicon projects planned for construction and expansion start production in 2010 and all of them use the Siemens process, the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by around 200 000 tons. When the difference in the technical level of these units is considered, the actual consumption will likely be higher. 
Something can already been seen from the market price trend of HSiCl3 in the past year or so. The price of HSiCl3 that was only an intermediate product and had small circulation in the silane coupling agent sector is still increasing dramatically today. By early March 2008 it rose to RMB19 000 per ton, more than doubling the price in just one year, and there are no signs whatsoever of the price going down. Besides the cost increase caused by the price rise of industrial silicon, the sudden entrance of polycrystalline silicon producers into the market as buyers is also an important reason for the skyrocketing price rise. Although most polycrystalline silicon producers have their own raw material units and hence do not purchase much HSiCl3, sales of HSiCl3 have still increased remarkably in recent years due to the great number of projects and buyers. 
Silane coupling agent producers using the indirect process are faced with a dilemma. They can achieve raw material self-sufficiency through purchasing industrial silicon themselves and protect themselves from the supply shortage and price rise of HSiCl3, but the price of industrial silicon has already grown rapidly, other costs are also on the increase, the competition in the downstream market has become fierce and it is harder to assure profits. In case the margin is further narrowed and the price of HSiCl3 increases further, how should silane coupling agent producers readjust their business? Should they make the direct sales of HSiCl3 to get profits or should they increase the price of products or improve the process to better their operation? 
In a not too distant future, the impacts of the drastic capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon on organosilicon enterprises will perhaps appear along with a competition for raw material industrial silicon. If the consumption of industrial silicon for polycrystalline silicon reaches 200 000 tons in 2010, its proportion of the total demand of industrial silicon will be around a quarter. The demand for industrial silicon in the organosilicon and alloy sectors will also increase drastically during that period. If the growth in the supply of industrial silicon slows down, polycrystalline silicon producers that have a strong financial standing will surely buy at high prices to ensure their own raw material supply. Some organosilicon enterprises that have made no breakthroughs in their high-end downstream consumption sectors and large-scale production technologies will very likely find themselves in a predicament in the next few years. 
It may not be possible to relieve the raw material shortage through rapid growth of the industrial silicon supply. Because production of industrial silicon is energy intensive, output in advanced countries has already shrunk greatly. China will no longer grant incentives for its production either, as evidenced by the readjustment to the export rebate and the export tariff policy and the elimination of the differential power price since early 2005. In such a scenario there is slim possibility of doubling the output of industrial silicon in China within three years to meet the domestic demand. 

3. Technical innovation: the best solution to raw material shortage

The negative impact of polycrystalline silicon production on the organosilicon sector is mainly reflected in the competition for raw material. That impact can be reduced in three cases. The first is that the total capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon turns out to be less than has been forecast. The second is that the supply of industrial silicon grows rapidly, but that prospect is already proved to be improbable. The third is that a new technical route is opened up, bypassing industrial silicon in producing either organosilicon or polycrystalline silicon, or remarkably increasing the utilization rate of silicon in polycrystalline silicon production.
The core technology for polycrystalline silicon production is monopolized by the United States, Japan and Germany. In spite of technical development over several years in Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., which started the first large-scale production in China and are still expanding capacity today, their technical level still lags behind foreign giants. 
Aside from these two companies, other projects in China have diversified technology sources and their technical personnel are mostly from the limited pool cultivated by Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. with many years' efforts. There is therefore a considerable risk of technological inadequacies in the smooth completion of these large projects, launched in haste. 
Besides, most of the projects launched in China will produce solar-grade products and target the photovoltaic cell. There will not be many electronic-grade products. Reasons for this are two. One is that enterprises take an unduly optimistic attitude toward the world photovoltaic power generation market. The other is that the technology for making electronic-grade products is not easily available. The reality, however, is that downstream of electronic-grade products is the large-scale IT industry with a great demand whereas the development fever of solar-grade products is mostly based on a demand that is not nearly so firmly established - the still-immature photovoltaic power generation market and a heavy reliance on incentives from various national governments. According to experts including Liu Hanyuan, the new downstream photovoltaic cell projects are more than polycrystalline silicon projects. Like the polycrystalline silicon sector, the capacity expansion of these photovoltaic cell projects is mainly located in China but the target market is mostly in foreign countries. Why is the capacity expansion made by foreign giants that have operated for several dozen years much slower than domestic enterprises? It is uncertain whether the new capacity to make photovoltaic cells can be smoothly digested in China, let alone the polycrystalline silicon capacity. History has shown that new things strongly advocated by governments or industrial circles do not necessarily turn out to be society's choice in the long run. Take one step back - even if photovoltaic power generation proves to be an energy alternative suitable to the national conditions in China, the actual growth of the market demand is yet to be verified. 
Making improvements to polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon manufacturing routes is likely to be the most feasible solution to the raw material supply shortage. In the polycrystalline silicon sector, if the proportion of smelting-process polycrystalline silicon is increased, the consumption of industrial silicon can be reduced and there is no problem of raw material shortage. If the utilization rate of silicon in the Siemens-process polycrystalline silicon production is increased, the industrial silicon supply shortage can also be very well eased. 
Another method is to combine organosilicon with polycrystalline silicon to achieve resource complementation and joint development. Guangzhou GBS High-Tech &amp; Industry Co., Ltd. is going all out to use byproduct silicon tetrachloride in the polycrystalline silicon production to produce gaseous-process silica white. Hydrogen, hydrogen chloride and HSiCl3 separated in the production can be recycled to the process. In this way the pollutant emission is reduced, the economic performance is improved and the bottleneck that has constrained the development of the polycrystalline silicon sector for so many years can also be removed. 
The fundamental way to solve the raw material supply shortage in the polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon production is the vigorous development of organosilicon chemistry. These two products have extensive applications. They are different from each other but come from the same element, silicon. Silicon is one of the most plentiful elements on earth. Its crust abundance is 25.8%, second only to oxygen and much higher than carbon. Silicon dioxide or silicates formed in the natural world can be seen everywhere. If silicon in the earth's crust can be used to directly synthesize organosilicon intermediates or products at a low cost, omitting the industrial silicon smelting that consumes great quantities of resources and power, organosilicon and polycrystalline silicon productions would benefit from inexhaustible low-priced raw material sources, and the development of these two chemical products and related sectors would enter a new era. 


Analysis of the World Trade of Metal Silicon
By kertherine mane ,CNCIC



Ⅰ. World imports

Silicon is a structural and functional material widely used in contemporary high-tech fields and important basic industries. It not only produces the semiconductor-grade polysilicon and optical fiber materials, but also is an indispensable basic raw materials in organic silicon industry. The H.S. Codes (Harmonized System Codes) of the silicon product discussed in this paper is 28046900. Japan, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands are four of the world's largest silicons importing countries. 2006-2007，the annual import amount of the silicons in these countries are more than 100 kiloton, and in 2007 these four countries contributed 58.4 percents of the total imports in the world.
Since 2002, the average unit import price of the silicon has been rising around the world. The price was 1,036 US$/ton in 2002, increased to 1,143 US$/ton in 2003, reached to 1,330 US$/ton in 2004, 1,383 US$/ton in 2005, and kept rising in 2006 when the price is 1,419 US$/ton. As the impact of high oil prices, in the year 2007, the average unit import price of the silicon increased by 25.8 percent of its in 2006, reached 1785 US$/ton.
Japan is the world's largest silicon importing country. Its annual import amount has raised from 189.7 kiloton in 2002 to 252 kiloton in 2007, the average annual growth rate is 5.8%. Since 2003, its annual import amount has been kept over 200 kiloton. China is Japan's largest source of silicon. In 2005, the amount of silicon importing from China to Japan was 85.8% of the total amount of silicon imports in Japan. This ratio increased to 89.2% in 2006, and 91.5% in 2007.
Germany is the world's second-largest silicon importing country. Brazil, Norway, France and the Netherlands are the main original country providing more than 70 percents of the imported silicon for Germany each year. Since 2005, the import volumes from Norway and the Netherlands have decreased, while the import volume from Brazil, France, Canada, Russia and China continue to increase. Imports from China surged from 2 kiloton in 2005 to 14.8 kiloton in 2006.
As the world's third largest importing country of silicon, the import volume of silicon of the United States has reduced in recent years. Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Australia and Norway are the main original country of the silicon for the United States.

South Africa had been the world's largest silicon exporting country. In 2002, South Africa exported 583.9 kiloton silicon, which was 39% of the total world exports. In 2003, its export volume rose to 767.1 kiloton, accounting for 29.7% of the total world exports. Because the silicon plant Ferroatlantica in South Africa stopped production, the export volume of silicon sharply declined from 556.6 kiloton in 2004 to 57.8 kiloton in 2005. In the year 2006 and 2007, the export volume of silicon in South Africa kept below 50 kiloton, only accounting for 4% of the world's total export volume. China used to be the world's second largest exporting country of silicon, in 2005, China has taken the place of the South Africa to be the world's largest silicon exporting country. China's share of the world export of the silicon have been increasing each year, from 25.9% in 2002, 18.5% in 2003, to 51% in 2006 and 53.3% in 2007. Brazil and Norway are two of the most important exporting countries of the silicon in the world, whose annual export volume is more than 140 kiloton.
Since 2003, the world’s average unit price of the exported silicon was only 447 US$/ton and this price almost doubled to 865 US$/ton in 2004. It kept comparatively stable in 2005 and 2006, 1,301 US$/ton and 1,326 US$/ton respectively. Due to the increase of the international energy price, the average unit price of the exported silicon climbed to 1,634 US$/ton in 2007.
China's export volume of the silicon is increasing year by year. In 2002, China exported 387.6 kiloton of the silicon, and in 2007 this figure reached 698.3 kiloton., The average annual growth rate is 12.5% during 2002 ~ 2007. China exports silicon to more than 50 countries and regions in the world. Japan has been China's biggest export destination, taking up 32% of the total export volume of China in recent years. China exports silicon to other countries and regions including Hong Kong, Korea, the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, the Netherlands and Canada.

Green Revolution 
of Silane Coupling Agent Industry

by Liao Jun   General Manager  
       Wuhan University Silicone New Material Co., Ltd.  
( WD SILICONE )


Alkoxyl silane is important raw material of bitch industry, whose structure general formula is HnSi(OR)4-n, where n is 0 or 1, R is alkyl such as: -CH3、-C2H5、-C3H6 and so on. As to industry, there are four important kinds of silane: methyltrimethoxylsilane (HSi(OCH3)3)and triethoxysilane (HSi(OC2H5)3), tetramethoxysilane (Si(OCH3)4) and tetraethoxy silane (Si(OC2H5)4).
Trialkoxysilane contains both Si-OR band which can be hydrolisis and Si-H which is very active. The structure enables it to be widespreadlly used in the industry, lots of silicon based products can be synthesized from it as raw material, such as large number of carbon functional silicon (mainly be silane coupling agent in industry), the silicone resin, the alkoxy terminated agent and polysilicon which were terminated by the linear polysiloxane et.al. Tetralkoxysilane is also an important silicon intermediate in the industry, it may be used to synthesize halogenate silane or carbon functional silane, synthetic silicone resin and crosslinking silica gel used for the two-group locellus warm curing. It can also be used as the special liquid medium for inorganic parent metal surface protection coating, high pure quartz material, nano silicon dioxide and high reinforcing white carbon by wet method and so on.

Advantage of direct synthetic method processing to product Alkoxyl silane 

 There are many methods to synthesize alkoxyl siliane, and the one to be most commonly used is chlorosilane alcoholysis method in the industrial world. Silicon powder used to make HSiCl3 and SiCl4 at first, and then to react with ROH (CH3OH or C2H5OH), alkoxyl silane can be prepared as soon as the alcoholysis reaction (etherification) began. It needs to introduce and remove chlorine   during the process, which is why this technology can not well admitted when it comes to the environmental protection, energy consumption and cost aspect.
The silicon/alcohol direct synthetic method is to use silicon powder and ROH (is mainly CH3OH and C2H5OH) as raw materials, while using copper as catalyst and reacted in the organic medium, alkoxyl silane can be synthesized in only one step reaction, trialkoxysilan and tetrakloxusilane are also obtained simultaneously. It is relatively simple to form tetrakloxusilane by this way, but what the factories pursue mainly at present is high selectivity of triakyoxysilane, so it is not a wise choice to take the direct synthetic method.
The direct synthetic method has advantages in processing step, resource usage efficiency, the environmental effect and the industrial angle, as we can find the differences between the two methods easily from Fig.2.
First of all, the direct synthetic method has realized one-step synthesis, reduced the process in great degree. Secondly, it needn’t to introduce chlorine during the technological process, thus avoiding problems caused by hydrogen chloride like equipment corrosion and interruption of recycling, and has realized clean production. Thirdly, because the reduction of reactants and no high corrodent existence in the technical process, the impurity content(such as: metal impurities and chloride ion) reduce obviously, the product quality has been greatly enhancement; Fourthly, the process efficiency is high and controllable, and it needn’t to rely on the large-scale chlorosilane installment any more, may facilitate the independent establishment process units. Finally, because the reduction of the reaction steps, efficiency of raw material use and energy raised largely, because reduction of high energy consume silica power, the electric power and charcoal are saved indirectly, and the emissions of greenhouse gas carbon monoxide is reduced as well, what’s more, the production cost is also largely cut.

Fig.1 Compare of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method
The reactions of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：
1)trialkoxysilane：
HSiCl3 + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
        HSi(OR)2Cl + ROH  → ClSi(OR)3 + H2
        HSi(OR)3 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O → polymer ＋ HCl
2)tetrakloxysilane：
SiCl4 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        Si(OR)4 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O →polymer ＋ HCl
The reactions of direct synthetic method:
Si + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 + H2
HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
Side reaction：ROH + Si → RSiH(OR)2 + RSi(OR)3 + H2O + H2
        HSi(OR)3 or Si(OR)4  + H2O → ≡SiOSi≡polymer ＋ ROH 
        HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 → polymer＋ H2O

There is “revolution” as to the silane coupling agent synthesized by direct synthetic method 

In fact, Rochow discovered the direct synthetic method to prepare alkoxyl silane from lower aliphatic alcohol and silicon powder early in 1948, but it didn’t attract enough attentions due to the poor condition at that time. At the end of the 20th century, along with the increasing demand of alkoxyl silane, as well as the great attentions to the resources utilization, the cost and the environment, research and industrial production in direct synthetic method develop fast. Especially in the recent 10 years, large scale production installments to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method have been set up and to be consummated, and expanded gradually.
Momentive Performance Materials (GE silicon at the beginning) established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method in the late-1990s, and its  productivity has achieved ten thousand ton now. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method at the beginning of this century, its productivity is about several thousand tons at present. A new process unit with 10 thousand ton productivity of trialkoxylsilane was begun to build in 2008. 
The main starting points to develop scale manufacture technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane are as follow: 1) to explode cleanly and highly effective processing technology for silicon coupling agent, 2) to provide raw materials with low cost and high quality for silicon coupling agent, 3) to meet the needs of the application of related domains.

Fig.2 Compare of the process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method

Process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：





Process of direct synthetic method：





The silane coupling agent industry is an independent branch in the industry chain of silicon, the dependence to chlorosilane reduces after the successfully development of direct synthetic method. As mentioned above, the direct synthetic method has omitted the raft step which uses chlorosilane and then avoided the corrosion and pollution, result in increasing of resource utilization and high quality products. More importantly, once the technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane in a low cost can be extending scale, the silane coupling agent industry and all related downstream industries which restrained to the problems of cost, supply and environmental protection will get large-scale supply of low cost alkoxyl silane raw material, and their development bottleneck will be broken thoroughly.
The old Witco Corporation of GE silicon (whose service has merged to Momentive Performance Materials) once point out that the direct synthetic method was “a revolutionary process for manufacture of organofunctional silanes”. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd. believed that the successfully explode of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane was the technology revolution of silane coupling agent industry, and to use this new technology was the development tendency of silane coupling agent industry.

Green industrial system and complete industrial chain base on the direct synthetic method building up

1. Promotion and consummation of processing technology 
The direct synthetic method has obvious superiority when compared to the chlorosilane alcoholysis method, but there are still a great number of works to do in order to get mature stable scale processing technology. For example: to further enhance the conversion rate of raw material and the selectivity of trialkoxylsilane, to enhance the controllability and secure of the process and so on. There are processing technology difficulties in 6 aspects: 1. design of chemical reaction process, like reaction condition, catalyst choice, reaction medium choice and so on; 2. process of agitation, including considerations dispersion and reaction kinetics; 3.process of inserting alcohol during the reaction, including the consideration of fast phase transformation; 4. separation processing of trialkoxylsilane and alcohol azeotropy; 5. technology of process amplification effect or scale production; 6. reaction medium processing and cyclic utilization.
Because of many industries have been involved in development of the direct synthetic method process, problems of entire system must be considered carefully and thoroughly as to this method. The key problems are as follow. Firstly, is about the comprehensive utilization of by-products including front cut fraction, middle distillate and high-boiling product, it is mainly about comprehensive utilization of the by-products produced by side reactions fact. Secondly, dual attentions must be given to the development of lower-stream application technology of alkoxyl silane, including the development of synthesis technology of silane coupling agent and the exploitation of other new products, and to ensure the value of industry chain's development from technical angle.
After further consummation of the technology, we believe completely that alkoxyl silane as a monomer will become more and more important in the silicon industry based on the direct synthetic method process which is environment friendly the low cost. The huge and prosperous adownstream derivative industries will be well developed to form an industrial system based on alkoxyl silane produced by direct synthetic method also.
At present, industrial system based on direct synthetic method to produce alkoxyl silane is still in its development initial period, the industrial chain hasn’t been established yet, so its major impact to silicon and the related industry is not that huge as it ought to be. The innovation technology's development and the rapid expansion of scale production of direct synthetic method have already promoted the development value of alkoxyl silane industry largely from the supply and cost, which indicate a bright future for the development of the industry in it industrial chain. To the development of this industrial system, we are willing to work hard together with all the other colleagues!

As the Chinese textile market growing, textile printing and dyeing of silicone oil consumption increased year by year. The consumption of silicone oil in China's textile printing and dyeing industries was about 38,000 ton in 2007, of which 30 % was supported by imported products, primarily imported from Dow Corning, Momentive, Shin-Etsu and Wacker. The domestic product was about 70 %, which was mainly composed by DMC, D4 and linear compound.
As to different textiles, the requirements of the silicone oil performance vary considerably, for example, chemical fiber requires slippery hand feeling and elastic performance, so the exhaustion  process was used generally. Currently, the amido-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization type) was used mostly, for the cost of the product was low, but its smoothness and elasticity need to be further improved.
The polyester sewing thread and embroidery threads used in yarn must be good at smoothness and sewing performance. And till now they have produced by the general exhaustion  process usually. Dimethyl silicone with good smoothness, low cost advantages was used primarily at present, but it still lack of fastness. Good silicone oil with good smoothness, tailoring and fastness performance should be developed in the future. The wool generally uses amino modified organosilicon softening agent at present (emulsion polymerization), the hand feeling is smooth, and the cost is low, but the product stability is low, and it is easy to be easy to delaminate and oil-disjunk, product with good stability and smooth must be developed in the future. The cotton thread has used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent also at present, which acts charitably smooth, but it was easilyy to cause detwisting and end-breakage. Due to mightness decreasing of treated yarn, most companies use Polythene wax at present.   
The cotton woven fabrics equest more smooth and softer hand feeling than any other fabrics. At present, If there were no requirement for hydrophilicity, amino-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization) would be normally adopted, result in good hand feeling and low cost, but it is easy to cause roller stick. When it comes to those cotton weave fabrics request for hydrophilicity, three kind of softening agents were used, including Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/Amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified Silicone softener. In these way, the cotton weave fabrics were hydrophilicity, no roller stick. After all, hydrophilicity and hand feeling are a pair of contradictory body, when the hydrophilicity are good, hand feeling is bad relatively. Good silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to roller stick and good sliding were still waiting for developing.
The knitted fabrics partly use amino modified organosilicon softening agent (polymerization), and the hand feeling is good, soft and fluffy while the cost is low. But it was suffered from roller stick easily and sticking cylinder easily. The other parts of knitted fabrics use Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and the Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer to match the laminated softening agent. The performance of to be not roller stick and hydrophilicity can choosed according to the demands, but it cost a lot to use these silicone oil, we must develop silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to cause roller stick, with smooth hand feeling and the fluffy, what’s more, the cost must be reduced in the future.
Woven polyester partily used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) with good smoothness and elsatic handfeeling, and its cost was low but easy roller stick. So the developing trend in the future is silicone oil with no roller stick, has good smooth and elastic handfeeling.
Two different types(one features smooth and elastic, the other features bulk) of amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) were choosed to use in T/R generally. It can make the product to have smooth, elastic handfeelingand good bulkness while the cost is low. But the disadvantage is thatApt to roller stick similarly. In addition, silicone oil produced by Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used here. It can conquer the disadvantage of apt to roller stick, while the disadvantage is that it is smoothness, elasticity and bulkness are not enough and high cost. 
The Polyester flocked fabric required the silicon to be soft, smooth, bulk and full handfeeling. And it adopt exhaustion process normally. Silicone oil usually produced by combination with two different kinds of Amino modified silicone softener (one features smooth and elastic, another one features bulk). The advantage is that it has soft and smooth handfeeling, good bulkness and low cost. And the disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick. Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used to prepare silicon oil. It is no roller stick, but lack of smoothness, bulkness, and the cost is high too.
Nylon required silicon oil to be soft and smooth handfeeling. Padding process was adopted normally. Silicone oil a form by amino modified silicone softener（bulk polymerization）was used primarily, which  owns advantage of soft and smooth handfeeling and low cost. The     disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick and the softness is not enough. When Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer were used,  the result is the it is no roller stick any more, but the disadvantage is that the softness is not enough.
As to flax, if it had no requirement for hydrophilicity, and amino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）was used to get smooth handfeeling and low cost while suffered from aptting to cause roller stick. If it had requirement for hydrophilicity, Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified silicone softener were used to obtain advantages of hydrophilicity and no roller stick but bad handfeeling relatively.
Woolen fabric required smooth and bulk handfeeling. Exhaustion process was adopted normally at present. The silicone oil used was formed by mino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）,whose advantages were good smoothness and low cost, but with disadvantages of unstable, apt to cause dilamination and oil-disjunktion. So the developing trend of silicone oil is  to produce silicon oil with good stability and smoothness to meet the requirement of the development of cowboy, cotton and kapok leisure clothing.

Silicone oil used for functional class processing applied will receive favors
The demand of silicone oil used in spinning and weaving in 2007 in our country was approximately 38,000 ton. It will increase quitely in the next everal years, especially to ready-made clothing which will grow fasfest, followed by the yarn next, and the knitting will occupy third, the weave occupies fourth.
 
Fig.7 Consumption potential (anticipating for increasing space)

Along with the diversification of textile, the demand of functionalization and high added value's silicone oil will increase. For example, the silicon oil to be used together with the hydrophilic composite in one-bath which can not effect the hydrophilic and good hand feeling were in greatly need. Silicon oil to be used together with the burning inhibitor in one-bath while the performances of flame-resistant and good hand feeling can’t be reduced were also needed. We also need silicon oil to be used togerther with the antistatic agent in one-bath to keep an anti-static electricity performance. To sum up, the great requirement of silicon to be used together with the hydrophilic, flame-resistant, soft, the anti-static electricity composites in one-bath, then fabric can be endowed with many kinds of functions as shown above. What’s more, if it was used together with the fixing agent in one-bath, their properties such as the hand feeling and color fastness can’t be affected.
The unceasingly pursue of the textile’s good performance will promote the silicone oil’s functionality. For example, silicon oil which can be used together with the dyeing in one-bath, silicon oil with super chemical stability which can be used used in jet machine, cotton-used silicone oil has cool hand feeling, new product can increase handfeeling and wet rubbing fastness. Silicone base color deepening agent, it can impart fabric with excellent color deepening effect. Stock stability is good. No effect to color fastness and good hand feeling.
The requirement for expanding application field of silicon product's will be further developed. Such as: silicone glue used in printing, silicone used in coating, silicone rubber which is compatible with printing and coating chemicals, silicone combined with polyurther to be used in coating, silicone combined with acrylic acid to be used in printing, silicone combined with fluocarbon to be used in water proof and so on.
As the rise of raw material's cost, the international pressure of the textile industry increases day by day. The textile of our country will trend to use functional and upscale silicone oil. What’s more, the environmental protection and energy conservation will also promote the silicone oil to be greener and more environmentally friendly.

Polycrystalline Silicon – What to Do?

By Bai Hongqiang, China National Chemical Information Center



1. Upsurge of polycrystalline silicon

Polycrystalline silicon is a basic material with extensive applications in the electronics and solar photovoltaic sectors. It was not very well known in the past. In the development of alternative energies triggered by the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; solar cell manufacturers have expanded capacity and their demand for polycrystalline silicon has grown rapidly. A serious supply shortage of polycrystalline silicon has developed all over the world. Despite full-capacity operation in most existing polycrystalline silicon units, the market demand can hardly be satisfied. The price of polycrystalline silicon has increased constantly, exceeding US$400 per kg at the end of 2007. The rising price has generated fat profits for producers. According to an annual performance statement published by a domestic polycrystalline silicon producer with a capacity of 50 t/a, the target of accomplishing a profit of RMB100 million in 2007 was attained in October 2007. 
Stimulated by fat profits, domestic polycrystalline silicon producers have expanded their capacities at an astonishing rate. The new capacity in China will reach 160 000-190 000 t/a in the next few years. More than 30 construction projects are planned, and most of them will start production around 2010. 
&quot;The growth of the photovoltaic sector is a dangerous thing,&quot; pointed out a report on the sector in 2007 prepared by a securities research institute. Although experts have constantly adjusted their forecasts upward, they always underestimate the demand growth in the market. 
It should be noted that government forces are also involved in this tide and have become one of the major features in this investment fever. According to statistics, governments of nearly 20 provinces and municipalities have already regarded the photovoltaic sector as the focus in the development of new sectors and the transformation of old sectors. They are all planning to launch polycrystalline silicon projects. 

2. Questions in the development of polycrystalline silicon

The major sector driving the growth of polycrystalline silicon market is the solar cell sector. Quality requirements for polycrystalline silicon used in electronics such as semiconductors are much higher than for solar-grade. Even for the solar-grade varieties, the production using smelting and purification are very difficult. The mainstream process for the production of polycrystalline silicon used today is the chemical method. The modified Siemens process (also called the HSiCl3 process) is the most popular. Comparatively speaking, the ASiMI process (the SiH4 process) and the granular polycrystalline silicon manufacturing technology and smelting process are not often used. 
The Siemens process uses HSiCl3 as raw material and consumes a great deal of material and energy. It has considerable impact on the indirect-process silane coupling agent sector, which also uses HSiCl3 as raw material. No matter what method is used, polycrystalline silicon production consumes great quantities of industrial silicon as the starting material. There is therefore a huge potential impact on the organosilicon sector, which also uses industrial silicon as raw material. 
Take the modified Siemens process for instance. Producing one ton of polycrystalline silicon needs around 10 tons of HSiCl3 (equivalent to 3.5 tons of industrial silicon). According to the estimates made by China Electronics Materials Industry Association, the output of polycrystalline silicon in China will reach around 3 000 tons in 2008, the consumption of HSiCl3 in the polycrystalline silicon sector will be around 30 000 tons and the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be around 10 000 tons. 
The output of industrial silicon in China is around 700 000 tons today. Two thirds of the output is exported. The remaining one third is used in the domestic market. Around 60% of it is used in organosilicon production and the balance is used in alloy casting. The organosilicon sector is developing rapidly today. It is expected that the capacity to make organosilicon monomer will reach around 1.80 million t/a in 2010 and the consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by more than 450 000 tons.
If one third (around 60 000 t/a) of polycrystalline silicon projects planned for construction and expansion start production in 2010 and all of them use the Siemens process, the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by around 200 000 tons. When the difference in the technical level of these units is considered, the actual consumption will likely be higher. 
Something can already been seen from the market price trend of HSiCl3 in the past year or so. The price of HSiCl3 that was only an intermediate product and had small circulation in the silane coupling agent sector is still increasing dramatically today. By early March 2008 it rose to RMB19 000 per ton, more than doubling the price in just one year, and there are no signs whatsoever of the price going down. Besides the cost increase caused by the price rise of industrial silicon, the sudden entrance of polycrystalline silicon producers into the market as buyers is also an important reason for the skyrocketing price rise. Although most polycrystalline silicon producers have their own raw material units and hence do not purchase much HSiCl3, sales of HSiCl3 have still increased remarkably in recent years due to the great number of projects and buyers. 
Silane coupling agent producers using the indirect process are faced with a dilemma. They can achieve raw material self-sufficiency through purchasing industrial silicon themselves and protect themselves from the supply shortage and price rise of HSiCl3, but the price of industrial silicon has already grown rapidly, other costs are also on the increase, the competition in the downstream market has become fierce and it is harder to assure profits. In case the margin is further narrowed and the price of HSiCl3 increases further, how should silane coupling agent producers readjust their business? Should they make the direct sales of HSiCl3 to get profits or should they increase the price of products or improve the process to better their operation? 
In a not too distant future, the impacts of the drastic capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon on organosilicon enterprises will perhaps appear along with a competition for raw material industrial silicon. If the consumption of industrial silicon for polycrystalline silicon reaches 200 000 tons in 2010, its proportion of the total demand of industrial silicon will be around a quarter. The demand for industrial silicon in the organosilicon and alloy sectors will also increase drastically during that period. If the growth in the supply of industrial silicon slows down, polycrystalline silicon producers that have a strong financial standing will surely buy at high prices to ensure their own raw material supply. Some organosilicon enterprises that have made no breakthroughs in their high-end downstream consumption sectors and large-scale production technologies will very likely find themselves in a predicament in the next few years. 
It may not be possible to relieve the raw material shortage through rapid growth of the industrial silicon supply. Because production of industrial silicon is energy intensive, output in advanced countries has already shrunk greatly. China will no longer grant incentives for its production either, as evidenced by the readjustment to the export rebate and the export tariff policy and the elimination of the differential power price since early 2005. In such a scenario there is slim possibility of doubling the output of industrial silicon in China within three years to meet the domestic demand. 

3. Technical innovation: the best solution to raw material shortage

The negative impact of polycrystalline silicon production on the organosilicon sector is mainly reflected in the competition for raw material. That impact can be reduced in three cases. The first is that the total capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon turns out to be less than has been forecast. The second is that the supply of industrial silicon grows rapidly, but that prospect is already proved to be improbable. The third is that a new technical route is opened up, bypassing industrial silicon in producing either organosilicon or polycrystalline silicon, or remarkably increasing the utilization rate of silicon in polycrystalline silicon production.
The core technology for polycrystalline silicon production is monopolized by the United States, Japan and Germany. In spite of technical development over several years in Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., which started the first large-scale production in China and are still expanding capacity today, their technical level still lags behind foreign giants. 
Aside from these two companies, other projects in China have diversified technology sources and their technical personnel are mostly from the limited pool cultivated by Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. with many years' efforts. There is therefore a considerable risk of technological inadequacies in the smooth completion of these large projects, launched in haste. 
Besides, most of the projects launched in China will produce solar-grade products and target the photovoltaic cell. There will not be many electronic-grade products. Reasons for this are two. One is that enterprises take an unduly optimistic attitude toward the world photovoltaic power generation market. The other is that the technology for making electronic-grade products is not easily available. The reality, however, is that downstream of electronic-grade products is the large-scale IT industry with a great demand whereas the development fever of solar-grade products is mostly based on a demand that is not nearly so firmly established - the still-immature photovoltaic power generation market and a heavy reliance on incentives from various national governments. According to experts including Liu Hanyuan, the new downstream photovoltaic cell projects are more than polycrystalline silicon projects. Like the polycrystalline silicon sector, the capacity expansion of these photovoltaic cell projects is mainly located in China but the target market is mostly in foreign countries. Why is the capacity expansion made by foreign giants that have operated for several dozen years much slower than domestic enterprises? It is uncertain whether the new capacity to make photovoltaic cells can be smoothly digested in China, let alone the polycrystalline silicon capacity. History has shown that new things strongly advocated by governments or industrial circles do not necessarily turn out to be society's choice in the long run. Take one step back - even if photovoltaic power generation proves to be an energy alternative suitable to the national conditions in China, the actual growth of the market demand is yet to be verified. 
Making improvements to polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon manufacturing routes is likely to be the most feasible solution to the raw material supply shortage. In the polycrystalline silicon sector, if the proportion of smelting-process polycrystalline silicon is increased, the consumption of industrial silicon can be reduced and there is no problem of raw material shortage. If the utilization rate of silicon in the Siemens-process polycrystalline silicon production is increased, the industrial silicon supply shortage can also be very well eased. 
Another method is to combine organosilicon with polycrystalline silicon to achieve resource complementation and joint development. Guangzhou GBS High-Tech &amp; Industry Co., Ltd. is going all out to use byproduct silicon tetrachloride in the polycrystalline silicon production to produce gaseous-process silica white. Hydrogen, hydrogen chloride and HSiCl3 separated in the production can be recycled to the process. In this way the pollutant emission is reduced, the economic performance is improved and the bottleneck that has constrained the development of the polycrystalline silicon sector for so many years can also be removed. 
The fundamental way to solve the raw material supply shortage in the polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon production is the vigorous development of organosilicon chemistry. These two products have extensive applications. They are different from each other but come from the same element, silicon. Silicon is one of the most plentiful elements on earth. Its crust abundance is 25.8%, second only to oxygen and much higher than carbon. Silicon dioxide or silicates formed in the natural world can be seen everywhere. If silicon in the earth's crust can be used to directly synthesize organosilicon intermediates or products at a low cost, omitting the industrial silicon smelting that consumes great quantities of resources and power, organosilicon and polycrystalline silicon productions would benefit from inexhaustible low-priced raw material sources, and the development of these two chemical products and related sectors would enter a new era. 


Analysis of the World Trade of Metal Silicon
By kertherine mane ,CNCIC



Ⅰ. World imports

Silicon is a structural and functional material widely used in contemporary high-tech fields and important basic industries. It not only produces the semiconductor-grade polysilicon and optical fiber materials, but also is an indispensable basic raw materials in organic silicon industry. The H.S. Codes (Harmonized System Codes) of the silicon product discussed in this paper is 28046900. Japan, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands are four of the world's largest silicons importing countries. 2006-2007，the annual import amount of the silicons in these countries are more than 100 kiloton, and in 2007 these four countries contributed 58.4 percents of the total imports in the world.
Since 2002, the average unit import price of the silicon has been rising around the world. The price was 1,036 US$/ton in 2002, increased to 1,143 US$/ton in 2003, reached to 1,330 US$/ton in 2004, 1,383 US$/ton in 2005, and kept rising in 2006 when the price is 1,419 US$/ton. As the impact of high oil prices, in the year 2007, the average unit import price of the silicon increased by 25.8 percent of its in 2006, reached 1785 US$/ton.
Japan is the world's largest silicon importing country. Its annual import amount has raised from 189.7 kiloton in 2002 to 252 kiloton in 2007, the average annual growth rate is 5.8%. Since 2003, its annual import amount has been kept over 200 kiloton. China is Japan's largest source of silicon. In 2005, the amount of silicon importing from China to Japan was 85.8% of the total amount of silicon imports in Japan. This ratio increased to 89.2% in 2006, and 91.5% in 2007.
Germany is the world's second-largest silicon importing country. Brazil, Norway, France and the Netherlands are the main original country providing more than 70 percents of the imported silicon for Germany each year. Since 2005, the import volumes from Norway and the Netherlands have decreased, while the import volume from Brazil, France, Canada, Russia and China continue to increase. Imports from China surged from 2 kiloton in 2005 to 14.8 kiloton in 2006.
As the world's third largest importing country of silicon, the import volume of silicon of the United States has reduced in recent years. Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Australia and Norway are the main original country of the silicon for the United States.

Ⅱ. World exports 

South Africa had been the world's largest silicon exporting country. In 2002, South Africa exported 583.9 kiloton silicon, which was 39% of the total world exports. In 2003, its export volume rose to 767.1 kiloton, accounting for 29.7% of the total world exports. Because the silicon plant Ferroatlantica in South Africa stopped production, the export volume of silicon sharply declined from 556.6 kiloton in 2004 to 57.8 kiloton in 2005. In the year 2006 and 2007, the export volume of silicon in South Africa kept below 50 kiloton, only accounting for 4% of the world's total export volume. China used to be the world's second largest exporting country of silicon, in 2005, China has taken the place of the South Africa to be the world's largest silicon exporting country. China's share of the world export of the silicon have been increasing each year, from 25.9% in 2002, 18.5% in 2003, to 51% in 2006 and 53.3% in 2007. Brazil and Norway are two of the most important exporting countries of the silicon in the world, whose annual export volume is more than 140 kiloton.
Since 2003, the world’s average unit price of the exported silicon was only 447 US$/ton and this price almost doubled to 865 US$/ton in 2004. It kept comparatively stable in 2005 and 2006, 1,301 US$/ton and 1,326 US$/ton respectively. Due to the increase of the international energy price, the average unit price of the exported silicon climbed to 1,634 US$/ton in 2007.
China's export volume of the silicon is increasing year by year. In 2002, China exported 387.6 kiloton of the silicon, and in 2007 this figure reached 698.3 kiloton., The average annual growth rate is 12.5% during 2002 ~ 2007. China exports silicon to more than 50 countries and regions in the world. Japan has been China's biggest export destination, taking up 32% of the total export volume of China in recent years. China exports silicon to other countries and regions including Hong Kong, Korea, the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, the Netherlands and Canada.

 
Fig.2  World export market of metal silicon from 2002 to 2007
Brazil’s export volume of the silicon has been comparatively stable, remaining at 180 kiloton to 200 kiloton each year. Brazil has always been a main exporting country of the silicon in the world. In 2005, Brazil became the largest industrial silicon-exporting country, second only to China. Brazil's silicon production mainly exports to the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Britain, France and other western developed countries.
Since 2005, Norway has been the world's third largest silicon exporting country. Its export volume has been comparatively stable since 2002, remaining at 140 kiloton to 180 kiloton each year. Norway's silicon production mainly exports to Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States and other developed western countries.

FOCUS

Green Revolution 
of Silane Coupling Agent Industry

by Liao Jun   General Manager  
       Wuhan University Silicone New Material Co., Ltd.  
( WD SILICONE )


Alkoxyl silane is important raw material of bitch industry, whose structure general formula is HnSi(OR)4-n, where n is 0 or 1, R is alkyl such as: -CH3、-C2H5、-C3H6 and so on. As to industry, there are four important kinds of silane: methyltrimethoxylsilane (HSi(OCH3)3)and triethoxysilane (HSi(OC2H5)3), tetramethoxysilane (Si(OCH3)4) and tetraethoxy silane (Si(OC2H5)4).
Trialkoxysilane contains both Si-OR band which can be hydrolisis and Si-H which is very active. The structure enables it to be widespreadlly used in the industry, lots of silicon based products can be synthesized from it as raw material, such as large number of carbon functional silicon (mainly be silane coupling agent in industry), the silicone resin, the alkoxy terminated agent and polysilicon which were terminated by the linear polysiloxane et.al. Tetralkoxysilane is also an important silicon intermediate in the industry, it may be used to synthesize halogenate silane or carbon functional silane, synthetic silicone resin and crosslinking silica gel used for the two-group locellus warm curing. It can also be used as the special liquid medium for inorganic parent metal surface protection coating, high pure quartz material, nano silicon dioxide and high reinforcing white carbon by wet method and so on.

Advantage of direct synthetic method processing to product Alkoxyl silane 

 There are many methods to synthesize alkoxyl siliane, and the one to be most commonly used is chlorosilane alcoholysis method in the industrial world. Silicon powder used to make HSiCl3 and SiCl4 at first, and then to react with ROH (CH3OH or C2H5OH), alkoxyl silane can be prepared as soon as the alcoholysis reaction (etherification) began. It needs to introduce and remove chlorine   during the process, which is why this technology can not well admitted when it comes to the environmental protection, energy consumption and cost aspect.
The silicon/alcohol direct synthetic method is to use silicon powder and ROH (is mainly CH3OH and C2H5OH) as raw materials, while using copper as catalyst and reacted in the organic medium, alkoxyl silane can be synthesized in only one step reaction, trialkoxysilan and tetrakloxusilane are also obtained simultaneously. It is relatively simple to form tetrakloxusilane by this way, but what the factories pursue mainly at present is high selectivity of triakyoxysilane, so it is not a wise choice to take the direct synthetic method.
The direct synthetic method has advantages in processing step, resource usage efficiency, the environmental effect and the industrial angle, as we can find the differences between the two methods easily from Fig.2.
First of all, the direct synthetic method has realized one-step synthesis, reduced the process in great degree. Secondly, it needn’t to introduce chlorine during the technological process, thus avoiding problems caused by hydrogen chloride like equipment corrosion and interruption of recycling, and has realized clean production. Thirdly, because the reduction of reactants and no high corrodent existence in the technical process, the impurity content(such as: metal impurities and chloride ion) reduce obviously, the product quality has been greatly enhancement; Fourthly, the process efficiency is high and controllable, and it needn’t to rely on the large-scale chlorosilane installment any more, may facilitate the independent establishment process units. Finally, because the reduction of the reaction steps, efficiency of raw material use and energy raised largely, because reduction of high energy consume silica power, the electric power and charcoal are saved indirectly, and the emissions of greenhouse gas carbon monoxide is reduced as well, what’s more, the production cost is also largely cut.

Fig.1 Compare of chlorosilane alcoholysis method and direct synthetic method
The reactions of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：
1)trialkoxysilane：
HSiCl3 + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
        HSi(OR)2Cl + ROH  → ClSi(OR)3 + H2
        HSi(OR)3 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O → polymer ＋ HCl
2)tetrakloxysilane：
SiCl4 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + HCl
Side reaction：ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
        Si(OR)4 + H2O → polymer ＋ ROH
        HSiCl3 + H2O →polymer ＋ HCl
The reactions of direct synthetic method:
Si + ROH → HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 + H2
HSi(OR)3 + ROH → Si(OR)4 + H2
Side reaction：ROH + Si → RSiH(OR)2 + RSi(OR)3 + H2O + H2
        HSi(OR)3 or Si(OR)4  + H2O → ≡SiOSi≡polymer ＋ ROH 
        HSi(OR)3 + Si(OR)4 → polymer＋ H2O

There is “revolution” as to the silane coupling agent synthesized by direct synthetic method 

In fact, Rochow discovered the direct synthetic method to prepare alkoxyl silane from lower aliphatic alcohol and silicon powder early in 1948, but it didn’t attract enough attentions due to the poor condition at that time. At the end of the 20th century, along with the increasing demand of alkoxyl silane, as well as the great attentions to the resources utilization, the cost and the environment, research and industrial production in direct synthetic method develop fast. Especially in the recent 10 years, large scale production installments to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method have been set up and to be consummated, and expanded gradually.
Momentive Performance Materials (GE silicon at the beginning) established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method in the late-1990s, and its  productivity has achieved ten thousand ton now. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd established process units to synthesize trialkoxylsilane by direct synthetic method at the beginning of this century, its productivity is about several thousand tons at present. A new process unit with 10 thousand ton productivity of trialkoxylsilane was begun to build in 2008. 
The main starting points to develop scale manufacture technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane are as follow: 1) to explode cleanly and highly effective processing technology for silicon coupling agent, 2) to provide raw materials with low cost and high quality for silicon coupling agent, 3) to meet the needs of the application of related domains.

Process of chlorosilane alcoholysis method：





Process of direct synthetic method：





The silane coupling agent industry is an independent branch in the industry chain of silicon, the dependence to chlorosilane reduces after the successfully development of direct synthetic method. As mentioned above, the direct synthetic method has omitted the raft step which uses chlorosilane and then avoided the corrosion and pollution, result in increasing of resource utilization and high quality products. More importantly, once the technology of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane in a low cost can be extending scale, the silane coupling agent industry and all related downstream industries which restrained to the problems of cost, supply and environmental protection will get large-scale supply of low cost alkoxyl silane raw material, and their development bottleneck will be broken thoroughly.
The old Witco Corporation of GE silicon (whose service has merged to Momentive Performance Materials) once point out that the direct synthetic method was “a revolutionary process for manufacture of organofunctional silanes”. Wuhan University silicon new material CO., Ltd. believed that the successfully explode of direct synthetic method to synthesize trialkoxylsilane was the technology revolution of silane coupling agent industry, and to use this new technology was the development tendency of silane coupling agent industry.

Green industrial system and complete industrial chain base on the direct synthetic method building up

1. Promotion and consummation of processing technology 
The direct synthetic method has obvious superiority when compared to the chlorosilane alcoholysis method, but there are still a great number of works to do in order to get mature stable scale processing technology. For example: to further enhance the conversion rate of raw material and the selectivity of trialkoxylsilane, to enhance the controllability and secure of the process and so on. There are processing technology difficulties in 6 aspects: 1. design of chemical reaction process, like reaction condition, catalyst choice, reaction medium choice and so on; 2. process of agitation, including considerations dispersion and reaction kinetics; 3.process of inserting alcohol during the reaction, including the consideration of fast phase transformation; 4. separation processing of trialkoxylsilane and alcohol azeotropy; 5. technology of process amplification effect or scale production; 6. reaction medium processing and cyclic utilization.
Because of many industries have been involved in development of the direct synthetic method process, problems of entire system must be considered carefully and thoroughly as to this method. The key problems are as follow. Firstly, is about the comprehensive utilization of by-products including front cut fraction, middle distillate and high-boiling product, it is mainly about comprehensive utilization of the by-products produced by side reactions fact. Secondly, dual attentions must be given to the development of lower-stream application technology of alkoxyl silane, including the development of synthesis technology of silane coupling agent and the exploitation of other new products, and to ensure the value of industry chain's development from technical angle.
After further consummation of the technology, we believe completely that alkoxyl silane as a monomer will become more and more important in the silicon industry based on the direct synthetic method process which is environment friendly the low cost. The huge and prosperous adownstream derivative industries will be well developed to form an industrial system based on alkoxyl silane produced by direct synthetic method also.
At present, industrial system based on direct synthetic method to produce alkoxyl silane is still in its development initial period, the industrial chain hasn’t been established yet, so its major impact to silicon and the related industry is not that huge as it ought to be. The innovation technology's development and the rapid expansion of scale production of direct synthetic method have already promoted the development value of alkoxyl silane industry largely from the supply and cost, which indicate a bright future for the development of the industry in it industrial chain. To the development of this industrial system, we are willing to work hard together with all the other colleagues!

The Application and Prospects of Silicone Used in Chinese Textile Industry
  by  Ju-Tao Luo  Deputy manager  Zhejiang Transfar Co., Led,



Textile processing region mainly distributed in littoral

China's textile processing region are mainly distributed in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong and other coastal areas. In the past two years, China's printing and dyeing cloth processing volume increasing year by year, as shown in Fig. 1. The total processing amount was 3.62 million ton in 2005, then the amount rose to 4.9 million ton in 2007, the average annual growth rate was about 16.3%. The processing amount of fabric in Zhejiang province was 26.8 billion meter, accounting for 55%. Jiangsu province produced 5.4 billion meter, accounting for 11% of the national total, Shandong province produced 4.6 billion meter, Guangdong province produced 4.3 billion meter, Fujian province produced 30 million meter , as shown in Fig. 2-3.

Fig.3 Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007
China's total output of knitted garments was 10.72 billion in 2007, compared to7.66 billion in 2005, the increased amount was 3.06 billion, with an average annual growth rate of about 18.3 %. the output of Guangdong province whose production of knitted garment ranked first in our country was 2.98 billion, accounting for 27.8 % of total output, followed by Zhejiang’s 2.14 billion (Fig. 4). The Change trend of total turn-out of processed fabric of different textile centers during 2005-2007 was shown in Fig.5, and the knitted garment production in Shandong province increased faster than any other provinces, with an average annual growth rate of 26.6 %. The knitted garment production in China this year─mainly effected by the textile trade-related policies─was the same as last year. China's total volume of knitted garments was 6.29 billion from January to July in 2008, of which Guangdong province produced 1.68 billion, accounting for 26.7 % of the total (Fig. 6).

Processing variety of different textile centers
As the Chinese textile market growing, textile printing and dyeing of silicone oil consumption increased year by year. The consumption of silicone oil in China's textile printing and dyeing industries was about 38,000 ton in 2007, of which 30 % was supported by imported products, primarily imported from Dow Corning, Momentive, Shin-Etsu and Wacker. The domestic product was about 70 %, which was mainly composed by DMC, D4 and linear compound.
As to different textiles, the requirements of the silicone oil performance vary considerably, for example, chemical fiber requires slippery hand feeling and elastic performance, so the exhaustion  process was used generally. Currently, the amido-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization type) was used mostly, for the cost of the product was low, but its smoothness and elasticity need to be further improved.
The polyester sewing thread and embroidery threads used in yarn must be good at smoothness and sewing performance. And till now they have produced by the general exhaustion  process usually. Dimethyl silicone with good smoothness, low cost advantages was used primarily at present, but it still lack of fastness. Good silicone oil with good smoothness, tailoring and fastness performance should be developed in the future. The wool generally uses amino modified organosilicon softening agent at present (emulsion polymerization), the hand feeling is smooth, and the cost is low, but the product stability is low, and it is easy to be easy to delaminate and oil-disjunk, product with good stability and smooth must be developed in the future. The cotton thread has used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent also at present, which acts charitably smooth, but it was easilyy to cause detwisting and end-breakage. Due to mightness decreasing of treated yarn, most companies use Polythene wax at present.   
The cotton woven fabrics equest more smooth and softer hand feeling than any other fabrics. At present, If there were no requirement for hydrophilicity, amino-modified silicone softener (emulsion polymerization) would be normally adopted, result in good hand feeling and low cost, but it is easy to cause roller stick. When it comes to those cotton weave fabrics request for hydrophilicity, three kind of softening agents were used, including Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/Amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified Silicone softener. In these way, the cotton weave fabrics were hydrophilicity, no roller stick. After all, hydrophilicity and hand feeling are a pair of contradictory body, when the hydrophilicity are good, hand feeling is bad relatively. Good silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to roller stick and good sliding were still waiting for developing.
The knitted fabrics partly use amino modified organosilicon softening agent (polymerization), and the hand feeling is good, soft and fluffy while the cost is low. But it was suffered from roller stick easily and sticking cylinder easily. The other parts of knitted fabrics use Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and the Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer to match the laminated softening agent. The performance of to be not roller stick and hydrophilicity can choosed according to the demands, but it cost a lot to use these silicone oil, we must develop silicone oil with good hydrophilicity, not to cause roller stick, with smooth hand feeling and the fluffy, what’s more, the cost must be reduced in the future.
Woven polyester partily used the amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) with good smoothness and elsatic handfeeling, and its cost was low but easy roller stick. So the developing trend in the future is silicone oil with no roller stick, has good smooth and elastic handfeeling.
Two different types(one features smooth and elastic, the other features bulk) of amino modified organosilicon softening agent (bulk polymerization) were choosed to use in T/R generally. It can make the product to have smooth, elastic handfeelingand good bulkness while the cost is low. But the disadvantage is thatApt to roller stick similarly. In addition, silicone oil produced by Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used here. It can conquer the disadvantage of apt to roller stick, while the disadvantage is that it is smoothness, elasticity and bulkness are not enough and high cost. 
The Polyester flocked fabric required the silicon to be soft, smooth, bulk and full handfeeling. And it adopt exhaustion process normally. Silicone oil usually produced by combination with two different kinds of Amino modified silicone softener (one features smooth and elastic, another one features bulk). The advantage is that it has soft and smooth handfeeling, good bulkness and low cost. And the disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick. Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer can also be used to prepare silicon oil. It is no roller stick, but lack of smoothness, bulkness, and the cost is high too.
Nylon required silicon oil to be soft and smooth handfeeling. Padding process was adopted normally. Silicone oil a form by amino modified silicone softener（bulk polymerization）was used primarily, which  owns advantage of soft and smooth handfeeling and low cost. The     disadvantage is that it is apt to cause roller stick and the softness is not enough. When Amino/polyether/silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer and Quaternary salt/Polyether/Silicone ternary block linear chain copolymer were used,  the result is the it is no roller stick any more, but the disadvantage is that the softness is not enough.
As to flax, if it had no requirement for hydrophilicity, and amino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）was used to get smooth handfeeling and low cost while suffered from aptting to cause roller stick. If it had requirement for hydrophilicity, Polyether/epoxy modified silicone softener, Polyether/amino modified silicone softener and Amino/Polyether modified silicone softener were used to obtain advantages of hydrophilicity and no roller stick but bad handfeeling relatively.
Woolen fabric required smooth and bulk handfeeling. Exhaustion process was adopted normally at present. The silicone oil used was formed by mino modified silicone softener（emulsion polymerization）,whose advantages were good smoothness and low cost, but with disadvantages of unstable, apt to cause dilamination and oil-disjunktion. So the developing trend of silicone oil is  to produce silicon oil with good stability and smoothness to meet the requirement of the development of cowboy, cotton and kapok leisure clothing.

Silicone oil used for functional class processing applied will receive favors
The demand of silicone oil used in spinning and weaving in 2007 in our country was approximately 38,000 ton. It will increase quitely in the next everal years, especially to ready-made clothing which will grow fasfest, followed by the yarn next, and the knitting will occupy third, the weave occupies fourth.
 
Fig.7 Consumption potential (anticipating for increasing space)

Along with the diversification of textile, the demand of functionalization and high added value's silicone oil will increase. For example, the silicon oil to be used together with the hydrophilic composite in one-bath which can not effect the hydrophilic and good hand feeling were in greatly need. Silicon oil to be used together with the burning inhibitor in one-bath while the performances of flame-resistant and good hand feeling can’t be reduced were also needed. We also need silicon oil to be used togerther with the antistatic agent in one-bath to keep an anti-static electricity performance. To sum up, the great requirement of silicon to be used together with the hydrophilic, flame-resistant, soft, the anti-static electricity composites in one-bath, then fabric can be endowed with many kinds of functions as shown above. What’s more, if it was used together with the fixing agent in one-bath, their properties such as the hand feeling and color fastness can’t be affected.
The unceasingly pursue of the textile’s good performance will promote the silicone oil’s functionality. For example, silicon oil which can be used together with the dyeing in one-bath, silicon oil with super chemical stability which can be used used in jet machine, cotton-used silicone oil has cool hand feeling, new product can increase handfeeling and wet rubbing fastness. Silicone base color deepening agent, it can impart fabric with excellent color deepening effect. Stock stability is good. No effect to color fastness and good hand feeling.
The requirement for expanding application field of silicon product's will be further developed. Such as: silicone glue used in printing, silicone used in coating, silicone rubber which is compatible with printing and coating chemicals, silicone combined with polyurther to be used in coating, silicone combined with acrylic acid to be used in printing, silicone combined with fluocarbon to be used in water proof and so on.
As the rise of raw material's cost, the international pressure of the textile industry increases day by day. The textile of our country will trend to use functional and upscale silicone oil. What’s more, the environmental protection and energy conservation will also promote the silicone oil to be greener and more environmentally friendly.

Polycrystalline Silicon – What to Do?

By Bai Hongqiang, China National Chemical Information Center



1. Upsurge of polycrystalline silicon

Polycrystalline silicon is a basic material with extensive applications in the electronics and solar photovoltaic sectors. It was not very well known in the past. In the development of alternative energies triggered by the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; solar cell manufacturers have expanded capacity and their demand for polycrystalline silicon has grown rapidly. A serious supply shortage of polycrystalline silicon has developed all over the world. Despite full-capacity operation in most existing polycrystalline silicon units, the market demand can hardly be satisfied. The price of polycrystalline silicon has increased constantly, exceeding US$400 per kg at the end of 2007. The rising price has generated fat profits for producers. According to an annual performance statement published by a domestic polycrystalline silicon producer with a capacity of 50 t/a, the target of accomplishing a profit of RMB100 million in 2007 was attained in October 2007. 
Stimulated by fat profits, domestic polycrystalline silicon producers have expanded their capacities at an astonishing rate. The new capacity in China will reach 160 000-190 000 t/a in the next few years. More than 30 construction projects are planned, and most of them will start production around 2010. 
&quot;The growth of the photovoltaic sector is a dangerous thing,&quot; pointed out a report on the sector in 2007 prepared by a securities research institute. Although experts have constantly adjusted their forecasts upward, they always underestimate the demand growth in the market. 
It should be noted that government forces are also involved in this tide and have become one of the major features in this investment fever. According to statistics, governments of nearly 20 provinces and municipalities have already regarded the photovoltaic sector as the focus in the development of new sectors and the transformation of old sectors. They are all planning to launch polycrystalline silicon projects. 

2. Questions in the development of polycrystalline silicon

The major sector driving the growth of polycrystalline silicon market is the solar cell sector. Quality requirements for polycrystalline silicon used in electronics such as semiconductors are much higher than for solar-grade. Even for the solar-grade varieties, the production using smelting and purification are very difficult. The mainstream process for the production of polycrystalline silicon used today is the chemical method. The modified Siemens process (also called the HSiCl3 process) is the most popular. Comparatively speaking, the ASiMI process (the SiH4 process) and the granular polycrystalline silicon manufacturing technology and smelting process are not often used. 
The Siemens process uses HSiCl3 as raw material and consumes a great deal of material and energy. It has considerable impact on the indirect-process silane coupling agent sector, which also uses HSiCl3 as raw material. No matter what method is used, polycrystalline silicon production consumes great quantities of industrial silicon as the starting material. There is therefore a huge potential impact on the organosilicon sector, which also uses industrial silicon as raw material. 
Take the modified Siemens process for instance. Producing one ton of polycrystalline silicon needs around 10 tons of HSiCl3 (equivalent to 3.5 tons of industrial silicon). According to the estimates made by China Electronics Materials Industry Association, the output of polycrystalline silicon in China will reach around 3 000 tons in 2008, the consumption of HSiCl3 in the polycrystalline silicon sector will be around 30 000 tons and the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be around 10 000 tons. 
The output of industrial silicon in China is around 700 000 tons today. Two thirds of the output is exported. The remaining one third is used in the domestic market. Around 60% of it is used in organosilicon production and the balance is used in alloy casting. The organosilicon sector is developing rapidly today. It is expected that the capacity to make organosilicon monomer will reach around 1.80 million t/a in 2010 and the consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by more than 450 000 tons.
If one third (around 60 000 t/a) of polycrystalline silicon projects planned for construction and expansion start production in 2010 and all of them use the Siemens process, the indirect consumption of industrial silicon will be increased by around 200 000 tons. When the difference in the technical level of these units is considered, the actual consumption will likely be higher. 
Something can already been seen from the market price trend of HSiCl3 in the past year or so. The price of HSiCl3 that was only an intermediate product and had small circulation in the silane coupling agent sector is still increasing dramatically today. By early March 2008 it rose to RMB19 000 per ton, more than doubling the price in just one year, and there are no signs whatsoever of the price going down. Besides the cost increase caused by the price rise of industrial silicon, the sudden entrance of polycrystalline silicon producers into the market as buyers is also an important reason for the skyrocketing price rise. Although most polycrystalline silicon producers have their own raw material units and hence do not purchase much HSiCl3, sales of HSiCl3 have still increased remarkably in recent years due to the great number of projects and buyers. 
Silane coupling agent producers using the indirect process are faced with a dilemma. They can achieve raw material self-sufficiency through purchasing industrial silicon themselves and protect themselves from the supply shortage and price rise of HSiCl3, but the price of industrial silicon has already grown rapidly, other costs are also on the increase, the competition in the downstream market has become fierce and it is harder to assure profits. In case the margin is further narrowed and the price of HSiCl3 increases further, how should silane coupling agent producers readjust their business? Should they make the direct sales of HSiCl3 to get profits or should they increase the price of products or improve the process to better their operation? 
In a not too distant future, the impacts of the drastic capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon on organosilicon enterprises will perhaps appear along with a competition for raw material industrial silicon. If the consumption of industrial silicon for polycrystalline silicon reaches 200 000 tons in 2010, its proportion of the total demand of industrial silicon will be around a quarter. The demand for industrial silicon in the organosilicon and alloy sectors will also increase drastically during that period. If the growth in the supply of industrial silicon slows down, polycrystalline silicon producers that have a strong financial standing will surely buy at high prices to ensure their own raw material supply. Some organosilicon enterprises that have made no breakthroughs in their high-end downstream consumption sectors and large-scale production technologies will very likely find themselves in a predicament in the next few years. 
It may not be possible to relieve the raw material shortage through rapid growth of the industrial silicon supply. Because production of industrial silicon is energy intensive, output in advanced countries has already shrunk greatly. China will no longer grant incentives for its production either, as evidenced by the readjustment to the export rebate and the export tariff policy and the elimination of the differential power price since early 2005. In such a scenario there is slim possibility of doubling the output of industrial silicon in China within three years to meet the domestic demand. 

3. Technical innovation: the best solution to raw material shortage

The negative impact of polycrystalline silicon production on the organosilicon sector is mainly reflected in the competition for raw material. That impact can be reduced in three cases. The first is that the total capacity expansion of polycrystalline silicon turns out to be less than has been forecast. The second is that the supply of industrial silicon grows rapidly, but that prospect is already proved to be improbable. The third is that a new technical route is opened up, bypassing industrial silicon in producing either organosilicon or polycrystalline silicon, or remarkably increasing the utilization rate of silicon in polycrystalline silicon production.
The core technology for polycrystalline silicon production is monopolized by the United States, Japan and Germany. In spite of technical development over several years in Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., which started the first large-scale production in China and are still expanding capacity today, their technical level still lags behind foreign giants. 
Aside from these two companies, other projects in China have diversified technology sources and their technical personnel are mostly from the limited pool cultivated by Emei Semiconductor Material Plant and Sichuan Xinguang Silicon Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. with many years' efforts. There is therefore a considerable risk of technological inadequacies in the smooth completion of these large projects, launched in haste. 
Besides, most of the projects launched in China will produce solar-grade products and target the photovoltaic cell. There will not be many electronic-grade products. Reasons for this are two. One is that enterprises take an unduly optimistic attitude toward the world photovoltaic power generation market. The other is that the technology for making electronic-grade products is not easily available. The reality, however, is that downstream of electronic-grade products is the large-scale IT industry with a great demand whereas the development fever of solar-grade products is mostly based on a demand that is not nearly so firmly established - the still-immature photovoltaic power generation market and a heavy reliance on incentives from various national governments. According to experts including Liu Hanyuan, the new downstream photovoltaic cell projects are more than polycrystalline silicon projects. Like the polycrystalline silicon sector, the capacity expansion of these photovoltaic cell projects is mainly located in China but the target market is mostly in foreign countries. Why is the capacity expansion made by foreign giants that have operated for several dozen years much slower than domestic enterprises? It is uncertain whether the new capacity to make photovoltaic cells can be smoothly digested in China, let alone the polycrystalline silicon capacity. History has shown that new things strongly advocated by governments or industrial circles do not necessarily turn out to be society's choice in the long run. Take one step back - even if photovoltaic power generation proves to be an energy alternative suitable to the national conditions in China, the actual growth of the market demand is yet to be verified. 
Making improvements to polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon manufacturing routes is likely to be the most feasible solution to the raw material supply shortage. In the polycrystalline silicon sector, if the proportion of smelting-process polycrystalline silicon is increased, the consumption of industrial silicon can be reduced and there is no problem of raw material shortage. If the utilization rate of silicon in the Siemens-process polycrystalline silicon production is increased, the industrial silicon supply shortage can also be very well eased. 
Another method is to combine organosilicon with polycrystalline silicon to achieve resource complementation and joint development. Guangzhou GBS High-Tech &amp; Industry Co., Ltd. is going all out to use byproduct silicon tetrachloride in the polycrystalline silicon production to produce gaseous-process silica white. Hydrogen, hydrogen chloride and HSiCl3 separated in the production can be recycled to the process. In this way the pollutant emission is reduced, the economic performance is improved and the bottleneck that has constrained the development of the polycrystalline silicon sector for so many years can also be removed. 
The fundamental way to solve the raw material supply shortage in the polycrystalline silicon and organosilicon production is the vigorous development of organosilicon chemistry. These two products have extensive applications. They are different from each other but come from the same element, silicon. Silicon is one of the most plentiful elements on earth. Its crust abundance is 25.8%, second only to oxygen and much higher than carbon. Silicon dioxide or silicates formed in the natural world can be seen everywhere. If silicon in the earth's crust can be used to directly synthesize organosilicon intermediates or products at a low cost, omitting the industrial silicon smelting that consumes great quantities of resources and power, organosilicon and polycrystalline silicon productions would benefit from inexhaustible low-priced raw material sources, and the development of these two chemical products and related sectors would enter a new era. 


Analysis of the World Trade of Metal Silicon
By kertherine mane ,CNCIC



Ⅰ. World imports

Silicon is a structural and functional material widely used in contemporary high-tech fields and important basic industries. It not only produces the semiconductor-grade polysilicon and optical fiber materials, but also is an indispensable basic raw materials in organic silicon industry. The H.S. Codes (Harmonized System Codes) of the silicon product discussed in this paper is 28046900. Japan, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands are four of the world's largest silicons importing countries. 2006-2007，the annual import amount of the silicons in these countries are more than 100 kiloton, and in 2007 these four countries contributed 58.4 percents of the total imports in the world.
Since 2002, the average unit import price of the silicon has been rising around the world. The price was 1,036 US$/ton in 2002, increased to 1,143 US$/ton in 2003, reached to 1,330 US$/ton in 2004, 1,383 US$/ton in 2005, and kept rising in 2006 when the price is 1,419 US$/ton. As the impact of high oil prices, in the year 2007, the average unit import price of the silicon increased by 25.8 percent of its in 2006, reached 1785 US$/ton.
Japan is the world's largest silicon importing country. Its annual import amount has raised from 189.7 kiloton in 2002 to 252 kiloton in 2007, the average annual growth rate is 5.8%. Since 2003, its annual import amount has been kept over 200 kiloton. China is Japan's largest source of silicon. In 2005, the amount of silicon importing from China to Japan was 85.8% of the total amount of silicon imports in Japan. This ratio increased to 89.2% in 2006, and 91.5% in 2007.
Germany is the world's second-largest silicon importing country. Brazil, Norway, France and the Netherlands are the main original country providing more than 70 percents of the imported silicon for Germany each year. Since 2005, the import volumes from Norway and the Netherlands have decreased, while the import volume from Brazil, France, Canada, Russia and China continue to increase. Imports from China surged from 2 kiloton in 2005 to 14.8 kiloton in 2006.
As the world's third largest importing country of silicon, the import volume of silicon of the United States has reduced in recent years. Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Australia and Norway are the main original country of the silicon for the United States.

Ⅱ. World exports 

South Africa had been the world's largest silicon exporting country. In 2002, South Africa exported 583.9 kiloton silicon, which was 39% of the total world exports. In 2003, its export volume rose to 767.1 kiloton, accounting for 29.7% of the total world exports. Because the silicon plant Ferroatlantica in South Africa stopped production, the export volume of silicon sharply declined from 556.6 kiloton in 2004 to 57.8 kiloton in 2005. In the year 2006 and 2007, the export volume of silicon in South Africa kept below 50 kiloton, only accounting for 4% of the world's total export volume. China used to be the world's second largest exporting country of silicon, in 2005, China has taken the place of the South Africa to be the world's largest silicon exporting country. China's share of the world export of the silicon have been increasing each year, from 25.9% in 2002, 18.5% in 2003, to 51% in 2006 and 53.3% in 2007. Brazil and Norway are two of the most important exporting countries of the silicon in the world, whose annual export volume is more than 140 kiloton.
Since 2003, the world’s average unit price of the exported silicon was only 447 US$/ton and this price almost doubled to 865 US$/ton in 2004. It kept comparatively stable in 2005 and 2006, 1,301 US$/ton and 1,326 US$/ton respectively. Due to the increase of the international energy price, the average unit price of the exported silicon climbed to 1,634 US$/ton in 2007.
China's export volume of the silicon is increasing year by year. In 2002, China exported 387.6 kiloton of the silicon, and in 2007 this figure reached 698.3 kiloton., The average annual growth rate is 12.5% during 2002 ~ 2007. China exports silicon to more than 50 countries and regions in the world. Japan has been China's biggest export destination, taking up 32% of the total export volume of China in recent years. China exports silicon to other countries and regions including Hong Kong, Korea, the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, the Netherlands and Canada.

 
Fig.2  World export market of metal silicon from 2002 to 2007
Brazil’s export volume of the silicon has been comparatively stable, remaining at 180 kiloton to 200 kiloton each year. Brazil has always been a main exporting country of the silicon in the world. In 2005, Brazil became the largest industrial silicon-exporting country, second only to China. Brazil's silicon production mainly exports to the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Britain, France and other western developed countries.
Since 2005, Norway has been the world's third largest silicon exporting country. Its export volume has been comparatively stable since 2002, remaining at 140 kiloton to 180 kiloton each year. Norway's silicon production mainly exports to Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States and other developed western countries.

==Adding industrial overview==
I have taken a business history approach and added an introduction about the current state of the industry, some history from Chandler, and a short bibliography. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] 20:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

Very good introduction. I note that US chemical trade balance is negative from 2002 -2005 according to the C&amp;EN article (7-10-06)(also www.cen-online.org).  Many of the produts have positive balances with most of the deficits being in &quot;medicinals &amp; pharmaceuticals&quot;. [[User:Oldsci|Oldsci]] 04:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

This entire page seems to be missing citations [[User:RichardFry|RichardFry]] ([[User talk:RichardFry|talk]]) 17:20, 24 May 2010 (UTC)

I have added a table to this page (Global Chemical Shipments by Country/Region in billions of dollars) as well as some other media and a 'See Also' section.  I hope this opens up more discussion as well as added contributions to increase its rating among the WikiProject Chemistry group.

Many of the produts have positive balances with most of the deficits being in &quot;medicinals &amp; pharmaceuticals&quot;. [[User:Oldsci|Oldsci]] 04:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

I have added a table to this page (Global Chemical Shipments by Country/Region in billions of dollars) as well as some other media and a 'See Also' section.  I hope this opens up more discussion as well as added contributions to increase its rating among the WikiProject Chemistry group.
