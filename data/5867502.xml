Maybe so.  But perhaps with different languages the country changes.  I could check that, therefor agreeing with you.  The Americans are self-centered sometimes. [[User:24.97.33.132|24.97.33.132]] 19:17, 11 December 2006 (UTC)Starletly</text>

== Content Needed ==

This article would benefit from a significantly deeper history section, evolution of the oil industry from 1700-present in particular. The formation of oil section is thin, but could link to petrol. Maybe more info about OPEC? current Russian oil? just more information in general, some of which is available in other articles, including [[Petroleum]].

==Supermajors?==
&quot;Supermajors&quot; is inconsistently used across Wikipedia: here Total is not included in other places it is. I always thought there were three super majors with a turnover of about 300m (E,BP,S) and the other 3 grouped at 180m (T,CP,ChT) were called majors but looking around the internet there is no consistency anywhere: so what do we do?

== US-centric? ==

First paragraph seems a little US-centric.  How about changing

&quot;Oil accounts for 40% of the United States' energy supply and a comparable percentage of the world’s energy supply.&quot; 

to

&quot;Oil accounts for 40% of the world's energy supply.&quot;

Maybe so.  But perhaps with different languages the country changes.  I could check that, therefor agreeing with you.  The Americans are self-centered sometimes. [[User:24.97.33.132|24.97.33.132]] 19:17, 11 December 2006 (UTC)Starletly

== Content Needed ==

This article would benefit from a significantly deeper history section, evolution of the oil industry from 1700-present in particular. The formation of oil section is thin, but could link to petrol. Maybe more info about OPEC? current Russian oil? just more information in general, some of which is available in other articles, including [[Petroleum]].

In the article it states that &quot;The production...of petroleum taken as a whole represent the single largest industry in terms of dollar value on earth.&quot;

Does this include the defense/space industry?

==Error in &quot;Top 10 largest world oil companies by reserves and production&quot; table?==

Not sure what's up with this table. There's two columns marked &quot;companies&quot; - not sure what the second one is referring to. --[[User:CircleAdrian|CircleAdrian]] ([[User talk:CircleAdrian|talk]]) 21:10, 21 April 2012 (UTC)

==Supermajors?==
&quot;Supermajors&quot; is inconsistently used across Wikipedia: here Total is not included in other places it is. I always thought there were three super majors with a turnover of about 300m (E,BP,S) and the other 3 grouped at 180m (T,CP,ChT) were called majors but looking around the internet there is no consistency anywhere: so what do we do? Acknowledge the lack of consistency in the text? --[[User:BozMo|BozMo]] [[user talk:BozMo|talk]] 12:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:While we are at it, we might mention the differences between these companies and state-owned companies, many of which are significantly larger, in terms of reserves and/or production, than ExxonMobil. --[[User:Geologyguy|Geologyguy]] 13:20, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== US-centric? ==

First paragraph seems a little US-centric.  How about changing

&quot;Oil accounts for 40% of the United States' energy supply and a comparable percentage of the world’s energy supply.&quot; 

to

&quot;Oil accounts for 40% of the world's energy supply.&quot;

Maybe so.  But perhaps with different languages the country changes.  I could check that, therefor agreeing with you.  The Americans are self-centered sometimes. [[User:24.97.33.132|24.97.33.132]] 19:17, 11 December 2006 (UTC)Starletly

== Content Needed ==

This article would benefit from a significantly deeper history section, evolution of the oil industry from 1700-present in particular. The formation of oil section is thin, but could link to petrol. Maybe more info about OPEC? current Russian oil? just more information in general, some of which is available in other articles, including [[Petroleum]].

== largest £ value industry ==

In the article it states that &quot;The production...of petroleum taken as a whole represent the single largest industry in terms of dollar value on earth.&quot;

Does this include the defense/space industry?

This article would benefit from a significantly deeper history section, evolution of the oil industry from 1700-present in particular. The formation of oil section is thin, but could link to petrol. Maybe more info about OPEC? current Russian oil? just more information in general, some of which is available in other articles, including [[Petroleum]].

== Carbon offsets for oil exploration and production companies ==
At present [[List_of_oil_exploration_and_production_companies|oil exploration and production companies]] currently don't pay for the [[Carbon_offset|carbon offsets]] of the burning of the total amount of crude oil they sell.

This seems unfair as other companies do pay carbon offsets, and it can be expected that the crude oil they sell will all be burned and its co² released into the atmosphere, so the amount of money needed to eliminate this (ie by planting forests) should be included in the sale price.

The local governments (which add a large tax on the product) should also pay their share, a same percentage as the tax they raise in comparison to the sale price of the crude oil.

==Question==
Are [[Lukoil]] and [[PetroChina]] truly government-owned companies? I'll have to alter the pie chart at the top of the graph if they form part of the private sector. From what I can gather, Lukoil is privately owned but heavily government-influenced. PetroChina is the &quot;listed arm of state-owned [[China National Petroleum Corporation]]&quot;. Thoughts?

== Carbon offsets for oil exploration and production companies ==
At present [[List_of_oil_exploration_and_production_companies|oil exploration and production companies]] currently don't pay for the [[Carbon_offset|carbon offsets]] of the burning of the total amount of crude oil they sell (about 0.43 metric tons CO2/barrel&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/refs.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

This seems unfair as other companies do pay carbon offsets, and it can be expected that the crude oil they sell will all be burned and its co² released into the atmosphere, so the amount of money needed to eliminate this (ie by planting forests) should be included in the sale price.

The local governments (which add a large tax on the product) should also pay their share, a same percentage as the tax they raise in comparison to the sale price of the crude oil.

== Environmental impact question ==
Shouldn't greater emphasis be given to the vast environmental impact the petroleum industry has? There are far more dimensions than water pollution. Perhaps there could be a mention in the first paragraph. What do other editors think? It is covered in another article,but I think there should nonetheless be more info here.[[User:Rwenonah|Rwenonah]] ([[User talk:Rwenonah|talk]]) 16:12, 24 December 2012 (UTC)</text>

==Error in &quot;Top 10 largest world oil companies by reserves and production&quot; table?==

Not sure what's up with this table. There's two columns marked &quot;companies&quot; - not sure what the second one is referring to. --[[User:CircleAdrian|CircleAdrian]] ([[User talk:CircleAdrian|talk]]) 21:10, 21 April 2012 (UTC)

==Supermajors?==
&quot;Supermajors&quot; is inconsistently used across Wikipedia: here Total is not included in other places it is. I always thought there were three super majors with a turnover of about 300m (E,BP,S) and the other 3 grouped at 180m (T,CP,ChT) were called majors but looking around the internet there is no consistency anywhere: so what do we do? Acknowledge the lack of consistency in the text? --[[User:BozMo|BozMo]] [[user talk:BozMo|talk]] 12:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:While we are at it, we might mention the differences between these companies and state-owned companies, many of which are significantly larger, in terms of reserves and/or production, than ExxonMobil. --[[User:Geologyguy|Geologyguy]] 13:20, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== US-centric? ==

First paragraph seems a little US-centric.  How about changing

&quot;Oil accounts for 40% of the United States' energy supply and a comparable percentage of the world’s energy supply.&quot; 

to

&quot;Oil accounts for 40% of the world's energy supply.&quot;

Maybe so.  But perhaps with different languages the country changes.  I could check that, therefor agreeing with you.  The Americans are self-centered sometimes. [[User:24.97.33.132|24.97.33.132]] 19:17, 11 December 2006 (UTC)Starletly

== Content Needed ==

This article would benefit from a significantly deeper history section, evolution of the oil industry from 1700-present in particular. The formation of oil section is thin, but could link to petrol. Maybe more info about OPEC? current Russian oil? just more information in general, some of which is available in other articles, including [[Petroleum]].

== largest £ value industry ==

In the article it states that &quot;The production...of petroleum taken as a whole represent the single largest industry in terms of dollar value on earth.&quot;

Does this include the defense/space industry?

{{Discussion top|1=The result was to '''merge''' [[Early uses of petroleum]] into [[Petroleum industry]]. -- [[User:Heds|Heds]] ([[User talk:Heds|talk]]) 06:43, 20 May 2009 (UTC)}}

Someone on the [[Early uses of petroleum]] page suggested that that page be merged into this one. I support this merge, as the 'early uses' page is a stub with little additional info, and it seems reasonable to include that info here under the history / early history section.

{{Substituted comment|length=342|lastedit=20080417195034|comment=The article states that &quot;The production (of)...petroleum taken as a whole represent the single largest industry in terms of dollar value on earth.&quot;

Does anybody know whether this includes the defensive/space industry?
I don't think it matters as the space industry is spending whereas petroleum is in the production realm

Since this is such an important topic with respect to every aspect of modern technology, the article should also provide a great sense of what oil is primarily being used in and challenges in alternative energy it may face in years ahead. If this were just about oil or gas it could be left out, however this article is about the petroleum industry in whole.</text>

Hi Josh, it's Daniel from ENGR 410. I used this subject as my edit piece too, but I kept my edits to the &quot;Water Pollution&quot; section. Prof wanted me to post on the talk page to let you know. Feel free to provide feedback if you want, and see you Wednesday, thanks!</text>

Hi Josh, it's Daniel from ENGR 410. I used this subject as my edit piece too, but I kept my edits to the &quot;Water Pollution&quot; section. Prof wanted me to post on the talk page to let you know. Feel free to provide feedback if you want, and see you Wednesday, thanks!

{{tq|Armenians established the oil industry in Azerbaijan, and the first person who drilled oil was Ivan Mirzoev. He is referred to as one of the 'founding fathers' of the oil industry in Baku.}}

Above statement is not correct. First could not find this ''&quot;Armenians established the oil industry in Azerbaijan&quot;'' not stated in provided sources. Secondly, Ivan Mirzoev can not be the first person who drilled oil well in 1872, because we have reports about the first land wells [https://books.google.az/books?id=Br74DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Smil,+Vaclav+(2017).+Energy+and+Civilization:+A+History&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwidw-Tm9of5AhVFRPEDHdqYDGUQ6AF6BAgKEAI#v=onepage&amp;q=1593&amp;f=false since 1593].

Secondly, Ivan Mirzoev can not be the first person who drilled oil well in 1872, because we have reports about the first land wells [https://books.google.az/books?id=Br74DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Smil,+Vaclav+(2017).+Energy+and+Civilization:+A+History&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwidw-Tm9of5AhVFRPEDHdqYDGUQ6AF6BAgKEAI#v=onepage&amp;q=1593&amp;f=false since 1593]. Checking thru the provided sources I also could not find anything confirming that Mirzoev was the fist person who drilled oil well.

==No Mention of Standard Oil?==

An article about the petroleum industry and there’s not a single mention of Standard Oil on the entire page? Standard Oil WAS the modern petroleum industry in the second half of the 19th Century, and it’s divested companies dominated the first half of the 20th Century. These energy companies are still dominant today in their current forms.
