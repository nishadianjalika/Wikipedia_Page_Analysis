Talk:Arms industry,Article expansion,"i work in security assistance in dealing with foreign military sales (fms), and have attended class at the defense institute for security assistance management (disam), but that doesn't make me an expert yet.  it really is a complex organization with stringent directives, much of which is outlined in the secretary of defense instruction titled (currently) ''joint security assistance training manual'' (jsat), and the soon to be completed jset which will replace the jsat.  let's face it, the world is not a safe place.  there are many reasons that we share our weapons, technology and practices (training) with other countries.  we share this with our allies to ensure that if and when we go into battle with them, we may have a better coordinated fight.  we give things to other countries as a gesture of good will.  another very important part that is commonly overlooked is that when international military students come to the u.s. to train, they get to see the u.s. for what it really is, and can take their (hopefully pleasant) experiences home with them to share with their friends and families.  since it is not uncommon for a  have served in their nations military, there is a chance that they may have attended training in the u.s.  this is in fact the case with king  of .  another thing to be looked at is countries that we may have obligations (under treaties) to defend, such is the case with  and the  (south korea).  if they purchase our technology (and the training to use it), it may partially relieve our responsibilities.  however, this article surely needs to be expanded.  foreign military sales (fms) is extremely important.  there should be separate articles for fms, imet, dcs, disam, international military student officer (imso) (my job), naval education and training security assistance field activity (netsafa), u.s. army security assistance training field activity (satfa), air force security assistance center (afsac), security assistance officer (sao) among others.  i would love to help write these articles, but i'm not an article writer.  i can help with facts, perhaps specific statistics, but i could not do it by myself.--",21/11/2005 4:09

($257/8 years  $32b/year, so unless the arms trade dropped by a factor of 25 in the next decade, those numbers are incorrect.)  the cited sources also give different values.  i added the contradiction flag at the top of the article, and added a sentence above the table telling people to go to the sources instead.  i don't know what the wiki-appropriate edit should have been, but i assume that this article is sufficiently watched that someone will be aroudn shortly to clean it up.  thank you.    the 'top arms exporters' table is now gone, so i removed the contradiction flag.  i clarified that the table that replaced it excludes china (see the cited references.)  an accurate and complete breakdown of arms traffic (npov, of course) would be a useful addition to this page.",22/04/2007 4:01

Talk:Arms industry,Invalid criticism of the United States,"a large part of this piece seems to be an attempt to slander the united states and does not objectively look at arms sales worldwide. no mention is made of other major arms exporters in the same light... small arms exports are mentioned, but based on the article one would think that the united states is the primary supplier of small arms, when in fact it is russia (whose ak-47 is the most widely produced assault weapon). i recommend that arms sales specifically related to the united states be moved to a new article titled, ""arms sales of the united states,"" and then that article broken down into sections where criticisms such as the ones that exist in this article can be put into proper context.  let's get it straight and speak only the truth.  what make people hate the states?  here is an example.  tell me what is wrong with this [ harold pinter the nobel prize in literature 2005]  and then there's this ""the united states is by far the largest exporter of weapons in the world, with a sales volume that exceeds the next 14 countries combined. military sales equate to about 18 percent of the federal budget, far and away the greatest proportion of any nation."" this is ridiculous! 18% of the $2.2 trillion federal budget (fy 2006) is $396 billion, yet according to sipri total arms sales worldwide totalled a maximum of $53 billion for 2004, with the united states making up approx. half of that.  ""according to the 2005 annual us congress reports, 58% of all us arms trade contracts are made with developing countries."" this is especially misleading, because nowhere in the article does it cite that russia is the largest exporter of arms to the developing world. (source cdi, ""u.s. arms still dominate international market, russia leader to developing world"" nov 15, 2006)  in summary, it seems that the intention of this article is to slander the united states by misleading the reader by using an extremely selective use of sources and ""facts"" that do not hold up to any kind of scrutiny. i recommend the united states be removed from this article entirely and be given its own entry. —the preceding  comment was added by",19/02/2007 8:46

Talk:Arms industry,AK-47 and Other Misunderstandings,"the  is the most widely-copied weapon in the world and, according to the russians, who would very much like a larger piece of the action, most are made illegally by nations and private enterprises which don't pay a license fee to the russian patent holder. so equating numbers of ak-47s with any sort of russian dominance seems hasty at best. even with developing countries, more than two thirds of russian transfers were to china and india, economic powerhouses in their own right and major military and nuclear powers besides. is it fair to equate these two nations with countries such as uganda or nigeria?  moreover, russian exports are steadily declining, and eu and israeli exports increasing, so statistics given for a range of years, especially in the past, may misstate the instantaneous, or even annual figures for the countries mentioned. see the current sipri report, among others.  it's also hard to equate the numbers released by the various agencies cited in both the main article and in these comments with reality, since terms of art, apples and oranges comparisons, and outright obfuscation mar most of them. sales to developing nations are not the same as the arms trade in its entirety, since a large part of us output, for example, goes to developed countries. canada, for example, buys from us, as do taiwan, australia, and many others, and all the official reports very clearly state that they reveal only unclassified information, so we must suppose that cia-mediated and other clandestine transfers don't show up in the statistics. in the end, the article relies on the informed guesswork of sipri and other organizations with somewhat less of an agenda and/or political mandate than many official government agencies.  the sipri report cited is actually last year's edition, and has been superceded by the 2006 version here [  sipri yearbook 2006]  [ l-3 communications] makes the sighting systems for weapons, as well as logistical support systems for military operations, so excluding it from the list, in this era of subcontractors taking on tiny bits of each finished product, seems slightly obsessive. one could easily carry this to extremes, and exclude the manufacturers of explosives, for example, because they have to be packed into a bomb in order to qualify as a weapon, or bullets, because they don't become weapons of war until fired from a gun at another human being. indeed, there are those who use ak-47s to hunt deer and other game, so perhaps many of these so-called assault rifles are actually intended for jolly bands of huntsmen, out to shoot ducks or quail.  likewise  profits from or substantially owns several defense companies. are the owners of a business somehow not responsible for what they produce? even if the relative amount of carlyle capital invested in weapons contractors is minor? one notes that aerospace & defense are specialties, while plowshares are not. not much money in the latter, one must suppose.",26/02/2007 14:31

Talk:Banana industry,External links modified,"bananas started to be traded internationally by the end of the fourteenth century. the development of railroads and technological advances in refrigerated maritime transport subsequently enable bananas to become the most traded fruit in the world. the bananas were given a resistance gene from either a wild relative or a nematode. in 2012, the researchers planted their transgenic bananas, along with unmodified controls, at a farm about 40 kilometers southeast of darwin, australia, where panama disease arrived 20 years ago. banana is an economically important cash crop as it fetches large revenue share in the domestic and international market. however, most of the production is consumed by the domestic population as it serves as the staple food for them. in the article genetically modified bananas to mitigate food security concerns,[1] bananas are vulnerable to both biotic and abiotic stress factors which limits their production. improvement of this crop to enhance the nutrient quality and better adapt to the changing environmental conditions and to produce new disease resistant varieties is essential. genetically modified organisms produced using scientific methods include recombinant dna technology and reproductive cloning. the article genetically modified organism[2] explains the importance in gmos and the safety of them. genetically modified organisms provide certain advantages to producers and consumers. modified plants, for example, can at least initially help protect crops by providing resistance to a specific disease or insect, ensuring greater food production. gmos are also important sources of medicine.  — preceding ] • )",2/11/2020 17:11

Talk:Electricity generation,Fuel cells,"fuel cells are like batteries in that they convert chemical energy to electrical energy, but they are different because batteries rely on chemicals built into the cell, while fuel cells consume fuel provided by an external source. i could see fuel cells being included, because eventually they may have a role in commercial electric generation, but batteries have no potential for such use, due to their high cost. (in principle, rechargeable batteries could be used to store energy for use during times of high demand, or to replace solar and wind energy at night or when the wind is calm, but as far as i know, this is not done except in small installations that are not connected to the grid.) --",9/05/2007 23:09

Talk:Electricity generation,Fuel cells,"sometimes fuel cell hydrogen is generated by water electrolysis, but fuel cells can and do use hydrocarbon fuels from a variety of sources. plus, some schemes use hydrogen extracted from hydrocarbon fuels rather than from water. i think drawing a line between ""storage"" and ""generation"" is pretty artificial anyway. by the storage criterion, i could argue that coal fired power plants should be excluded because they aren't generating electricity. the energy in coal was stored by plants 200 million years ago, after all. if you can hook a voltmeter up to it and the needle moves, it's generating electricity.",10/05/2007 17:26
Talk:Electricity generation,Fuel cells," perhaps you are right, both batteries and fuel cells do generate or produce electricity.  i do consider coal, oil, and natural gas stored solar energy, so strictly speaking the stars are the only energy generators in the universe.  all the more reason to use the most direct forms of solar energy (heat, pv, wind, hydro).  even the heavy atoms in nuclear fuels are solar byproducts.  having been burning fossil fuels so intensively for the last century we are in effect reversing the photosynthetic processes that occurred over the past hundreds of millennium, essentially reversing the time/age/balance of the earth natural systems, which seems like a pretty dangerous experiment to me.  anyway, i'm not sure if there's a point other than if a fuel cell section is added then i would also be inclined to add a battery section.  --",10/05/2007 18:35
Talk:Electricity generation,Fuel cells,"the lead paragraph of the article clearly indicates the article is about commercial electric generation, which would exclude off-grid small scale electric generation, such as generators in automobiles, batteries used in portable devices (e.g. ipods), etc. it might be useful to put links to articles about small-scale generation in the see also section, if there are any such articles.  considering the new information about use of batteries by a utility, i suppose that could go in this article. --",10/05/2007 18:40

Talk:Food industry,General Format & Topics Suggestions,"i came across this page when looking up a discussion on ""food processing.""   it was redirrected to ""food industry.""   i see it here as a sub-topic.  as a food industry professional, who has gone on to be a chef, i would suggest that some changes should be made to reflect more how the industry actually operates.   i understand the page was started with a quick outline some time ago, but i think some things should be re-formated.  here's some examples of the different segments of the industry   farms/ growers  food manufacturers (namely smaller independent, regional or national companies)  food conglomerates(namely multinational or global enterprises that represent the new economy and control more aspects of the total product, from production, packaging, marketing, distribution, etc.)  disosable supply manufacturers they make everything from napkins, food containers, plastic forks and knives, plastic and aluminum wraps, chef hats, etc.  light equipment manufacturers  they make everything from ceramic platewares, glassware, cooking utensils, tableware, pots and pans, etc.  heavy equipment manufacturers they make everything from stoves, steamers, ventilation hoods, preparation tables, etc.  industrial equipment and machine manufacturers  they make the equipments and machines that help produce and process any food items, from agriculture to meat industry and to canning and beyond.  distributors  these are made up of smaller local, regional and national companies.  there are also specialized distributors, broadliners, master-distributors and re-distributors.  not only that, but distribution is often split between retail and wholesale/ foodservice.   broadliners try to do everything, but many companies are select in things like dry goods, alcohol, cleaning supplies, meats, produce, etc.   street salesman are less numerous in these companies nowadays, as companies push sales to the internet, telephone and the the like.  brokers these people traditionaly represent the manufacturere or conglomerates and have more than one company that they promote.   they act like the liason between the  manufacturers and the distributors, for instance.  their primary objective is to move major units; i.e., by the pallet or truckloads.   but they often help sales teams target end users in either restaurants or retail.   they often have the advertising materials and promotions, either in material form or even negotiated dollar rebates.  in the past years, brokers have seen an attack against their role in the industry as companies consolidate lines, promote more on the internet and re-organize the distribution of product through laterally, totally integrated companies.  importers and exporters  the united states probably relies on imported goods than many other compmanies.   we have both a national cuisine and a tradition of imported foods.   this segment leads both into retail and wholesale/ foodservice, but is an enormous segment to itself.  companies are licensed and specialized solely in importing and exporting, although some act like master distributors and importers of various product lines.   aside, from that, this segment of the industry has its own sets of regulations and also relies on the ocean going shipping industry or cross-border trade routes, either by train or truck, to mexico and canada.  europe and other places are now organized under their european union, under a common currency and new trade laws.  transportation, freight forwarding and logistics   this segment crosses over into categories, but is really a growing influential enterprise that stands somewhat independent and yet supports the food industry itself.  the trend is to ""trace"" product from its very original source to its movenent into the network and out to the end user.  for example, niman ranch meat products is a leader in ""tracing"" every piece of meat that goes out.  but this industry works with everyone, from manufacturers, to distributors, to importers and beyond.   it was traditionally about ""carriers"" and paper bill of ladings and other documents, but nowadays this segment of the industry is forcing technology into the process, eliminating actual ""paper"" to the digital preferance.   it is also increasing the fast pace of the movement of product around the world, the increase of the number of units and creating a new inventory and purchasing approach that is as only ""as needed"" or delivered overnight.   perishable products that were never available in the united states or other parts of the world can now be sent overnight across the world, thus introducing products to people that have never before been available.  foodsevice & hospitality  this makes up mostly the ""professional"" sector of restaurants and hotels.   people that work on this side of the industry often disdain the ""retail"" sectors.   they work with primarily distributors and brokers and the like that deal with their segment of the foodservice and hospitalit sectors.   food products that are marketed and packaged to the foodservice and hospitality trade are obviously of a different standard than that of retail, so the decision makers in this facet of the business are often quite discriminating.  retail  this is made up of grocery stores, convenience shops, vending machines, and specialty consumer based shops.   nowadays, the larger grocery chains are controlling more and more of their product from product sourcing to distribution to the sale to the end user.   ""mom & pop"" shops in the united states are falling out.  regulation this is made up largely by the goverment and its different divisions, from federal to state and local.   it is also very controversial, as regultion changes can force changes throughout the industry and often very disputed by both professionals and the public alike.  likewise, the industry is often regulated by itself with various member associations and political groups that are controlled by various interest groups that advocate, regulate, certify and even lobby government, etc.   there is even an arm of the goverment and private sector that ""educates"" professionals and the public, sometimes in the interest of advocacy, or for trends and the like.  finance and credit  there are indeed companies that specialize in financing the food sector, as well as doing credit analysis and legal matters, etc.   companies that are traded on the world's stock exchanges are a world to themeselves and are now competing with regional and domestic companies in the fastly ""globalizing"" economy.  education/ certification  the rise of educated and certified chefs in the united states is incredible, as is the growth of schools and institutions.   they certainly vary in size and specialty, just like any secondary learning institution.  trade shows, publishing and media   more convergence has occurred in this sector over the last few years.   trade shows like the fancy food show and the western foodservice & hospitality show are gaining more criticism it seems, as perhaps less persuasion.  broadline distributors are creating thier own shows, taking away from cross industry forums.  manufacturers are also trying to control their marketing representation and get the best bang for the buck, transferring this marketing promotion and cost to others, if need be.  therefore, deals are made for exclusives in large distribution companies, warehouse stores and the lie, where inventory warehoused and promotions and rebates are received at that level.   meanwhile television networks, trade associations and publishers are promoting new celebrity chefs, cookbooks, internet sites and so on.",26/01/2008 22:53

Talk:Music industry,Toning down business section bias,"the business structure section contains a paragraph about the sale of sound recordings and how this translates into royalties for artists. prior to my edits of 10 and 13 sep 2009, this aspect of the music industry was characterized too simply. by failing to mention that the labels' revenues from sales of sound recordings are not ""royalties"", and that the disbursement of actual royalties from such sales depends on the contracts artists have with labels, the reader is misled into accepting the romantic notion that ''all'' artists receive royalties from ''any'' sales of the sound recordings they participated in, which is untrue — some recordings are ""works for hire"" for which the artist receives no royalties whatsoever, and more commonly, contracts with artists (such as one i have, myself) require a minimum level of sales to recoup the label's investment before the artists are entitled to any royalties. furthermore, the vast majority of sound recordings generate little or no revenue, as demonstrated by prs chief economist will page's recent article refuting the 'long tail' theory as it applies to online music sales.[ that is, sales correspond to popularity, and the popular recordings are only a small portion of those available. thus it's improper to imply that ''all'' recordings generate revenues, let alone royalties. imho such oversimplifications indicate bias, perhaps unintentional, in favor of the labels and publishers who stand to gain from it.  that's why i made the following edits, which were soon reverted by   ''when cds sell…part of the money is returned to the performers in the form of royalties'' is an example i changed, as per the above rationale, so it doesn't cut out the very important middleman, the record label. i changed it to ''when cds sell…part of the money is returned to the sound recording copyright owners — the record companies — who may, depending on the agreements they have with the performers, share a portion of that money with the performers in the form of royalties.''  an anonymous visitor changed ''most recordings ''only earn royalties'' for a short period after they are released.'' to ''most recordings ''generate substantial revenues'' for a short period after they are released.'' the edit summary said ''previous version…made it sound like royalties stopped being paid after a short period of time which is not true.'' i see how the change does alleviate the stated concern, but it resulted in the statement ''most recordings generate substantial revenues'' which is, as i mentioned above, insufficient. i changed it to ''most recordings, if they generate substantial revenues, generate them only for a short period after they are released.''  the clause ''after which the song becomes part of the ""back catalogue"" or library'' was grammatically incorrect due to disagreement in number (recordings vs. song), and didn't explain what being in the ""back catalogue"" means, economically. i changed it to a separate sentence ''afterward, the songs become part of the ""back catalogue"" or library, where they become candidates for future re-release, such as on compilations or licensed for use in film or television.''  this pair of sentences was somewhat awkward ''a much smaller number of recordings have become ""classics"", with longstanding popularity, such as albums by the beatles or the rolling stones. these albums have continued to earn royalties for the surviving band members decades after their original release date.'' the second sentence is really just referring to the beatles and rolling stones albums, but it's too easy to read it as meaning that artists get royalties from ''all'' classic albums. again this is just an example of painting with too broad a brush, probably not even intentionally, and my attempt to improve it by replacing ''surviving band members'' with ''record companies'' (although i forgot to change ''royalties'' to ''revenues'') shouldn't be regarded as disingenuous.  lastly, the  brand & software isn't quite the same thing as the  online music vendor, so i replaced mentions of itunes with itunes store. this shouldn't have been blindly reverted along with my other edits.  i went ahead and re-did my edits, adjusted a bit and incorporating ""david t tokyo""'s additional fixes, but omitting my back-catalogue clarification, so the paragraph now reads as follows ''when cds sell in stores or on websites such as the itunes store, part of the money obtained by the record label for the sales may be paid to the performers in the form of royalties. of the recordings which generate substantial revenues for the labels, most do so only for a short period after they are released, after which the song becomes part of the label's ""back catalogue"" or library. a much smaller number of recordings have become ""classics"", with longstanding popularity, such as cds by the beatles or the rolling stones. these albums have continued to generate revenue for the labels and often, in turn, royalties for artists, long after their original release.''  of course the fact remains that this entire section is mostly uncited. that shouldn't be used as an excuse to retain inaccurate and misleading generalizations. the entire article is fair game for continued improvement, and the addition of citations is part of that. i will devote as much time as i can to seeking out references where necessary. if there are specific claims that anyone feels need attributions more than others, please tag them as needing citations so i can give them higher priority. thanks! —",14/09/2009 7:14
Talk:Music industry,Toning down business section bias,"i agree with your edits and i agree very strongly that this section needs to be rewritten both for clarity and comprehensiveness. the section is very poorly organized, in my view. it dwells on some details and ignores others. as a whole, i don't think it really explains how the money flows through the music business from ticket sales and retail into the pockets of musicians, promoters, managers, record companies and everyone else.  what we need is a paragraph that describes the basic ''idea'' of a recording contract first, and then finds a simple way to list all the caveats. traditional recording contracts are insanely complicated (think of ""free goods"") and have only become more complicated and varied in the 21st century, as lawyers, managers and record companies attempt to re-invent the business. there is almost nothing you can say about record contracts that applies to all of them, or even the majority of them.  however, this article needs to get across the basic ideas first. there is a shocking number of people out there who think that recording artists aren't ""really"" paid by itunes at all.  anyway, having said that, i apologize that i don't have the time to write a truly ''elementary'' introduction to the business of music that is well organized, sourced and flows well. if either of you is interested in doing a major overhaul of this section, i would help with what i can. ----",7/01/2011 23:10

Talk:Music industry,Streaming,"the ifpi's declining sales figures, and the way they are presented here, implies that the record industry has x% less money than it did before and that piracy is the one and only reason for that. but these figures are selective and misleading. physical product sales are certainly in decline. some pundits attribute the decline in music purchases to consumer disillusionment with a decline in quality and homogenization of music, but i haven't seen any compelling evidence to back that up. what i have seen reported is 1. less physical product is being made (arguably in response to declining sales), 2. there's increasing competition from other forms of entertainment (video and games, especially), 3. since the mid-2000s, people have been buying more digital product (downloads from web stores), and 4. a not-insignificant number of would-be customers resorted to piracy. more recently, though, piracy and sales of both physical and digital product have been getting hit by 5. competition from streaming in all its forms (net radio, cloud storage, social music), both licensed and unlicensed (although digital sales are still up, apparently). you're right, these streaming services aren't as profitable for the industry as product sales, but i've seen reports that non-product-sales sources of revenue are more than making up for the decline in product sales (see below); so piracy is, arguably, a red herring, and the music industry is profiting more than ever. it's ok to talk about piracy and shifts in what forms of music and other entertainment are responsible, but we shouldn't be saying anything in the article to make it seem like the music industry is collapsing and that it's all due to piracy. the industry is booming, piracy is on the decline, and there are notable shifts in where and how consumers are spending their entertainment budgets. for numbers, probably a very good source is the trove of reports at [ dow jones statista]; just enter 'music' in the search box. a fair amount of their content requires paid access, but you can probably do a web search for the title of the stats/reports in question and find third-party reports based on the same data. however, i tend to be drawn more to infographics  [ dance on demand a look at the modern social music revolution]  [ are 360 deals a lifeline for the music industry?]  [ evolution of music the impact of digital on the music industry]  [ music subscription faceoff how does spotify measure up?]  [ digital music downloads are taking over] here are more sources  [ the sky is rising] - infographic + report  [ what's working in music - having a ball - in the supposedly benighted music business, a lot of things are making money] - from ''the economist''  [ media piracy in emerging economies] - chapter 1 discusses how industry stats are misleading and manipulated  [ copyright infringement and enforcement in the us] - includes info about relationship between piracy, sales, streaming  [ hadopi (french ""3 strikes law"") report] - shows piracy in sharp decline in 2011, and music/movie industry revenues in slight decline; critics see it as evidence the industry has problems other than piracy pro-file-sharing blog  occasionally conducts analyses of recent industry reports. here are a couple that touch on the topic at hand  [ anti-piracy warnings have no effect on itunes sales]  [ riaa innovation is the best way to kill piracy] and here's an interesting pair from bpi; draw your own conclusions (i know, we're not allowed to, but still)  [ new bpi report shows illegal downloading remains serious threat to britain's digital music future] - dec 2010  [ uk digital music sales pass the £1bn milestone] - may 2011 i know i've seen more, but these are just the ones i found in my bookmarks and with some cursory searches. i can do more research as time permits. if nothing else, i hope this convinces you of the need to acknowledge non-piracy factors, especially the rise of streaming/social music services as a significant factor in the decline of physical product sales, and more generally just to be cautious and not just blindly parrot the music industry's selective statistics and pronouncements. —",26/05/2012 8:12
Talk:Music industry,Streaming,"the article does '''not''' blame file sharing for the decline in revenues. it just reports that there is a decline. it does not identify the source of the decline. it criticizes the ""law enforcement"" approach taken by the riaa. it even mentions that there exist sources that claim that the decline in revenues isn't due to filesharing. (and in fact, i tend to agree; as steve jobs argued in his ""no more drm"" letter, the real culprit is probably cd-burning, not filesharing. university of georgia professor and musician david lowery argues in [ this] that the cause of the decline is just the crappy structure of the deals that the technology industry has offered musicians. he may have a point.)  i need to look at your sources more closely. but at first glance, i have to say this, and i don't mean to offend. some of your sources claim there has been no decline. i'm sorry, but these source have no more merit than holocaust denials. for those of us who work in the industry, the decline is obvious and the signs of it have been everywhere major, well loved and well run firms (like tower records, a&m studios or the hit factory) have been forced out of business. people we know have lost their jobs. surely, in 2012, we don't need to argue any more about whether the music industry has lost a truckload of money.  ----",7/06/2012 8:25

Talk:Music industry,Streaming,"thanks, but i think we're somewhat talking past each other, here.  we agree that people are streaming more and buying less, and what they do buy isn't as profitable as the cash cow that was cds in the '90s. and we agree that streaming is way less profitable than sales, and that it apparently doesn't offset the decline in revenue (although i'd like to see some aggregate numbers, not the oft-quoted per-listen or per-song figures, which ''of course'' aren't as profitable as downloads, why should they be?).  in the article, there's a sequence of things that are said. to paraphrase 1. revenues for physical product and downloads of recorded music declined greatly from 1999 to 2008. 2. the industry has downsized and struggled to adjust. 3. one of the first things they did in this period was shut down a number of file-sharing services (napster being the most famous one), and threatened thousands of individual file-sharers, but this didn't stop the decline in revenue.  now, you say this doesn't imply that the industry solely blames piracy for its decline in sales revenue, but i say it does. i don't see how you can read it otherwise. there's nothing about what one of the sources i mentioned calls the end of the digital “replacement cycle”, nothing about ipods, nothing about people buying tracks more than albums, nothing about people substituting purchases with streaming, nothing about people substituting purchases of music with non-music entertainment options (video games, dvds/blu-ray, streaming video), nothing about people streaming music instead of buying, nothing about the fact that the music industry has other sources of revenue besides sales.  the point of emphasizing that the ifpi's figures are for a very specific type of revenue stream (""sales, not streaming"") was not intended to suggest that the rise of streaming has appreciably compensated for the sales-revenue decline, or even to say that the industry's losses are overstated, although i do have my doubts (to the extent that they're selective about which figures they draw attention to, not the figures themselves). i was mainly just trying to downplay the subsequent emphasis on piracy—i.e., the arguably false implication that revenues are down solely because consumers are still getting music but have stopped paying for it, when in fact they've shifted their spending to a variety of options. certainly there are those who engage in file-sharing of doubtful legality, but gobs of people are flocking to legal options...it's just that these legal alternatives to buying cds simply do not have the profit margins of cd sales.  really, the article needs more than just a mention of streaming, in order to put sales-revenue figures in proper context. we need other metrics besides revenues, and a more complete picture of revenue sources than just sales. we also need a more thorough breakdown of what shifts are occurring in consumer spending. however, that's more than i have time for... ) —",7/06/2012 11:44
Talk:Music industry,Streaming,"it's important to say this very precisely. first, '''many in the industry blame file sharing for the decline'''. this is simply a fact, and this article must report well-sourced facts. as you point out, the article implies this passively without saying it exactly. however, the article does ''not'' state that '''file sharing is the cause of the decline'''. this is not a fact, it is an opinion (and one which both you and i disagree with). there is even a sentence in the article that denies this opinion, despite the fact that this is very much a minority point of view.  to address your issues we could (1) make sure we have the right aggregate numbers for streaming, digital downloads and physical media. (i am confident that this number will only differ by a few percent, but of course the article would be improved by the perfect number.) (2) beef up the sentence that denies file sharing is the cause of the decline. mention job's letter and some of your sources. (to me, this post-game debate is somewhat pointless, but there's no reason not to give it another sentence.) (3) add a bit more about how artists (especially older acts) have raised ticket prices and pushed merchandise harder to increase revenues. note, however, that the big acts could have raised their prices in any decade, and they are only doing so now as a reaction to the decline in sales revenues. as such, it is not really relevant to a discussion of the severity or causes of the decline.  there is a simple, obvious and important story here. people stopped spending as much on recorded music, and the industry has had to change. this is the main point that the article needs to get across. the reasons they stopped spending money on recorded music are complicated and some of them are in dispute, but the main story is very simple. all of these minor issues should probably be covered in the article  rather than here. ----",14/06/2012 18:17

(1) consumer electronics, such as digital music players, at 100 billion or so i think. they pay 0% to musicians. (2) radio advertising, which i would think is about 15 or 20 billion, which pays less than 1% to record companies (and, if you count independent promoters, they actually ''charge'' musicians money). if you add in live music (at around 20 billion) you get a number close what 168 billion. some of these (consumer electronics, live music) are increasing in value, so that would explain why this info graphic reports an increase. but the lion's share of this increase is in consumer electronics. i think it's hardly fair to count ""consumer electronics"" as part of the music industry to give the impression that the music industry is increasing in value. if there's no musician in the money chain, it's not the music industry, as far as i'm concerned.  of course, i am speculating about the source of these numbers, and i could be wrong. there's no way to tell, because (ironically) the full article is not freely downloadable. they want to get paid. ironic and hypocritical. ----",20/06/2012 5:39
Talk:Music industry, Reading the sources ," [ what's working in music - having a ball - in the supposedly benighted music business, a lot of things are making money] - from ''the economist'' this article explicitly describes the downturn, and places the blame on piracy, which is the opposite of the point i think you're trying to make. to quotefor the past ten years sales of recorded music have declined so steeply as to become a cautionary tale about the disruptive power of the internet. the rise of illegal file-sharing and the end of the digital “replacement cycle”, in which people bought cds to replace tapes and records, caused spending to collapse. sales of cds, tapes and records have slid by 40% in britain since 2001, according to the bpi, which represents record labels. in japan, the world’s biggest cd sales market, the number of discs sold fell by 6% in 2008 and 24% in 2009. price cuts meant that revenues dropped even more steeply.  the rise in digital music-sales is scant compensation. people tend to buy tracks, not albums, from sites like apple’s itunes. they can obtain their favourite music much more cheaply than they could in the cd era. and even digital sales are now stalling. the article goes on to report on how revenues from live music and merchandise have increased, mostly because ticket prices for the big acts (u2, gaga, etc.) have gone through the roof. as i said earlier, i think this is off-topic the issue we are discussing is the decline in revenues for recorded music, not the increase in live music ticket prices. live music obviously has no connection to piracy. (unless you want to argue that the fact that i have two jobs means that i deserve to be paid less for my first job, which is nonsense.)  having said that, i should say i'm happy to include a little more about the increase in revenue from live music, and maybe this even deserves it's own paragraph. this is a great citation for that.

(they also make a speculative argument that jump might have something to do with spotify's rise to power the previous year, the idea being that this dropped sales in other countries. this argument requires us to believe that, for some reason, the buzz on spotify skipped france and that the buzz suddenly stopped, coincidentally, the same month hadopi was debated.)  this is way too small a detail to be discussed in this article. at any rate, note that the article describes the enforcement option as a ""disaster"", so it is certainly not biased towards the music industry on the issue of enforcement. ----",20/06/2012 5:39

Talk:Tobacco industry,"""Conflicting Points of View""","the conflicting points of view section appears relatively skewed towards the tobacco industry. the first paragraph itself is somewhat fair, but the second paragraph provides a completely unsupported statement in favor of the industry, which is not in any way offset by any statement in opposition of the industry (that produces a product proven to carry severe health issues).  also, ""conflicting points of view,"" seems like an odd choice for a header.  — preceding ] • )",6/12/2014 14:50

Talk:Wood industry,Rapa Nui,"the whole section about rapa nui at the end of the page has proven to be a wrong interpretation of archaeological and historical facts, sometimes the facts themselves being proven false. i really ''would'' do some research and give some sources of information but i just came here in the middle of writing my thesis so i hope you'll uderstand i have other things to do. the knowledge of the history of easter island i have comes from a talk at my university by an expert on the subject. it basically states taht there was no huge ecological crisis and no civil war whatsoever but rather a smooth change from one form of belief and lifestyle to another as the island changed. most fo what the thought we knew comes from the people of easter island that don't really know anything about their past as sickness and slavery decimated the population (esopecially the older people that knew the history of their kind). so anything they said to the first explorers who took interst in their culture was a delusional reconstitution they made with whatever they had left of their culture. i mean it's a pretty sad story but it's not one of civil war between malnourished people.  — preceding ]",31/07/2017 13:38
