Talk:Arms industry,Article expansion,"i work in security assistance in dealing with foreign military sales (fms), and have attended class at the defense institute for security assistance management (disam), but that doesn't make me an expert yet.  it really is a complex organization with stringent directives, much of which is outlined in the secretary of defense instruction titled (currently) ''joint security assistance training manual'' (jsat), and the soon to be completed jset which will replace the jsat.  let's face it, the world is not a safe place.  there are many reasons that we share our weapons, technology and practices (training) with other countries.  we share this with our allies to ensure that if and when we go into battle with them, we may have a better coordinated fight.  we give things to other countries as a gesture of good will.  another very important part that is commonly overlooked is that when international military students come to the u.s. to train, they get to see the u.s. for what it really is, and can take their (hopefully pleasant) experiences home with them to share with their friends and families.  since it is not uncommon for a [[head of state]] have served in their nations military, there is a chance that they may have attended training in the u.s.  this is in fact the case with king [[abdullah ii]] of [[jordan]].  another thing to be looked at is countries that we may have obligations (under treaties) to defend, such is the case with [[japan]] and the [[republic of korea]] (south korea).  if they purchase our technology (and the training to use it), it may partially relieve our responsibilities.  however, this article surely needs to be expanded.  foreign military sales (fms) is extremely important.  there should be separate articles for fms, imet, dcs, disam, international military student officer (imso) (my job), naval education and training security assistance field activity (netsafa), u.s. army security assistance training field activity (satfa), air force security assistance center (afsac), security assistance officer (sao) among others.  i would love to help write these articles, but i'm not an article writer.  i can help with facts, perhaps specific statistics, but i could not do it by myself.--[[user:asacan|asacan]]","04:09, 21 november 2005"

Talk:Arms industry,Contradiction (since removed)," the values in the top arms exporters table seems to be completely wrong.  the total of the top arms exporters for 2006 is $1.2billion, whereas the article also states ""from 1989 to 1996, the global value of direct commercial arms sales was us$257 billion, of which 45% was exported from the us"".  ($257/8 years = $32b/year, so unless the arms trade dropped by a factor of 25 in the next decade, those numbers are incorrect.)  the cited sources also give different values.  i added the contradiction flag at the top of the article, and added a sentence above the table telling people to go to the sources instead.  i don't know what the wiki-appropriate edit should have been, but i assume that this article is sufficiently watched that someone will be aroudn shortly to clean it up.  thank you.

Talk:Arms industry,Invalid criticism of the United States,"a large part of this piece seems to be an attempt to slander the united states and does not objectively look at arms sales worldwide. no mention is made of other major arms exporters in the same light... small arms exports are mentioned, but based on the article one would think that the united states is the primary supplier of small arms, when in fact it is russia (whose ak-47 is the most widely produced assault weapon). i recommend that arms sales specifically related to the united states be moved to a new article titled, ""arms sales of the united states,"" and then that article broken down into sections where criticisms such as the ones that exist in this article can be put into proper context. :: let's get it straight and speak only the truth.  what make people hate the states?  here is an example.  tell me what is wrong with this: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture-e.html harold pinter the nobel prize in literature 2005]  and then there's this: ""the united states is by far the largest exporter of weapons in the world, with a sales volume that exceeds the next 14 countries combined. military sales equate to about 18 percent of the federal budget, far and away the greatest proportion of any nation."" this is ridiculous! 18% of the $2.2 trillion federal budget (fy 2006) is $396 billion, yet according to sipri total arms sales worldwide totalled a maximum of $53 billion for 2004, with the united states making up approx. half of that.  ""according to the 2005 annual us congress reports, 58% of all us arms trade contracts are made with developing countries."" this is especially misleading, because nowhere in the article does it cite that russia is the largest exporter of arms to the developing world. (source: cdi, ""u.s. arms still dominate international market, russia leader to developing world"" nov 15, 2006)  in summary, it seems that the intention of this article is to slander the united states by misleading the reader by using an extremely selective use of sources and ""facts"" that do not hold up to any kind of scrutiny. i recommend the united states be removed from this article entirely and be given its own entry. —the preceding [[wikipedia:sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[special:contributions/215.65.50.34|215.65.50.34]] ([[user talk:215.65.50.34|talk]])","08:46, 19 february 2007"

Talk:Arms industry,AK-47 and Other Misunderstandings,"the [[ak-47]] is the most widely-copied weapon in the world and, according to the russians, who would very much like a larger piece of the action, most are made illegally by nations and private enterprises which don't pay a license fee to the russian patent holder. so equating numbers of ak-47s with any sort of russian dominance seems hasty at best. even with developing countries, more than two thirds of russian transfers were to china and india, economic powerhouses in their own right and major military and nuclear powers besides. is it fair to equate these two nations with countries such as uganda or nigeria?  moreover, russian exports are steadily declining, and eu and israeli exports increasing, so statistics given for a range of years, especially in the past, may misstate the instantaneous, or even annual figures for the countries mentioned. see the current sipri report, among others.  it's also hard to equate the numbers released by the various agencies cited in both the main article and in these comments with reality, since terms of art, apples and oranges comparisons, and outright obfuscation mar most of them. sales to developing nations are not the same as the arms trade in its entirety, since a large part of us output, for example, goes to developed countries. canada, for example, buys from us, as do taiwan, australia, and many others, and all the official reports very clearly state that they reveal only unclassified information, so we must suppose that cia-mediated and other clandestine transfers don't show up in the statistics. in the end, the article relies on the informed guesswork of sipri and other organizations with somewhat less of an agenda and/or political mandate than many official government agencies.  the sipri report cited is actually last year's edition, and has been superceded by the 2006 version here: [http://yearbook2006.sipri.org/  sipri yearbook 2006]  [http://www.l-3com.com/ l-3 communications] makes the sighting systems for weapons, as well as logistical support systems for military operations, so excluding it from the list, in this era of subcontractors taking on tiny bits of each finished product, seems slightly obsessive. one could easily carry this to extremes, and exclude the manufacturers of explosives, for example, because they have to be packed into a bomb in order to qualify as a weapon, or bullets, because they don't become weapons of war until fired from a gun at another human being. indeed, there are those who use ak-47s to hunt deer and other game, so perhaps many of these so-called assault rifles are actually intended for jolly bands of huntsmen, out to shoot ducks or quail.  likewise [[carlyle group]] profits from or substantially owns several defense companies. are the owners of a business somehow not responsible for what they produce? even if the relative amount of carlyle capital invested in weapons contractors is minor? one notes that aerospace & defense are specialties, while plowshares are not. not much money in the latter, one must suppose.

Talk:Banana industry,External links modified,"bananas started to be traded internationally by the end of the fourteenth century. the development of railroads and technological advances in refrigerated maritime transport subsequently enable bananas to become the most traded fruit in the world. the bananas were given a resistance gene from either a wild relative or a nematode. in 2012, the researchers planted their transgenic bananas, along with unmodified controls, at a farm about 40 kilometers southeast of darwin, australia, where panama disease arrived 20 years ago. banana is an economically important cash crop as it fetches large revenue share in the domestic and international market. however, most of the production is consumed by the domestic population as it serves as the staple food for them. in the article genetically modified bananas: to mitigate food security concerns,[1] bananas are vulnerable to both biotic and abiotic stress factors which limits their production. improvement of this crop to enhance the nutrient quality and better adapt to the changing environmental conditions and to produce new disease resistant varieties is essential. genetically modified organisms produced using scientific methods include recombinant dna technology and reproductive cloning. the article genetically modified organism[2] explains the importance in gmos and the safety of them. genetically modified organisms provide certain advantages to producers and consumers. modified plants, for example, can at least initially help protect crops by providing resistance to a specific disease or insect, ensuring greater food production. gmos are also important sources of medicine.  — preceding [[wikipedia:signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[user:emarieva|emarieva]] ([[user talk:emarieva#top|talk]] • [[special:contributions/emarieva|contribs]])","17:11, 2 november 2020"

Talk:Food industry,General Format & Topics Suggestions,"i came across this page when looking up a discussion on ""food processing.""   it was redirrected to ""food industry.""   i see it here as a sub-topic.  as a food industry professional, who has gone on to be a chef, i would suggest that some changes should be made to reflect more how the industry actually operates.   i understand the page was started with a quick outline some time ago, but i think some things should be re-formated.  here's some examples of the different segments of the industry:   farms/ growers  food manufacturers (namely smaller independent, regional or national companies)  food conglomerates(namely multinational or global enterprises that represent the new economy and control more aspects of the total product, from production, packaging, marketing, distribution, etc.)  disosable supply manufacturers: they make everything from napkins, food containers, plastic forks and knives, plastic and aluminum wraps, chef hats, etc.  light equipment manufacturers:  they make everything from ceramic platewares, glassware, cooking utensils, tableware, pots and pans, etc.  heavy equipment manufacturers: they make everything from stoves, steamers, ventilation hoods, preparation tables, etc.  industrial equipment and machine manufacturers:  they make the equipments and machines that help produce and process any food items, from agriculture to meat industry and to canning and beyond.  distributors:  these are made up of smaller local, regional and national companies.  there are also specialized distributors, broadliners, master-distributors and re-distributors.  not only that, but distribution is often split between retail and wholesale/ foodservice.   broadliners try to do everything, but many companies are select in things like dry goods, alcohol, cleaning supplies, meats, produce, etc.   street salesman are less numerous in these companies nowadays, as companies push sales to the internet, telephone and the the like.  brokers: these people traditionaly represent the manufacturere or conglomerates and have more than one company that they promote.   they act like the liason between the  manufacturers and the distributors, for instance.  their primary objective is to move major units; i.e., by the pallet or truckloads.   but they often help sales teams target end users in either restaurants or retail.   they often have the advertising materials and promotions, either in material form or even negotiated dollar rebates.  in the past years, brokers have seen an attack against their role in the industry as companies consolidate lines, promote more on the internet and re-organize the distribution of product through laterally, totally integrated companies.  importers and exporters:  the united states probably relies on imported goods than many other compmanies.   we have both a national cuisine and a tradition of imported foods.   this segment leads both into retail and wholesale/ foodservice, but is an enormous segment to itself.  companies are licensed and specialized solely in importing and exporting, although some act like master distributors and importers of various product lines.   aside, from that, this segment of the industry has its own sets of regulations and also relies on the ocean going shipping industry or cross-border trade routes, either by train or truck, to mexico and canada.  europe and other places are now organized under their european union, under a common currency and new trade laws.  transportation, freight forwarding and logistics:   this segment crosses over into categories, but is really a growing influential enterprise that stands somewhat independent and yet supports the food industry itself.  the trend is to ""trace"" product from its very original source to its movenent into the network and out to the end user.  for example, niman ranch meat products is a leader in ""tracing"" every piece of meat that goes out.  but this industry works with everyone, from manufacturers, to distributors, to importers and beyond.   it was traditionally about ""carriers"" and paper bill of ladings and other documents, but nowadays this segment of the industry is forcing technology into the process, eliminating actual ""paper"" to the digital preferance.   it is also increasing the fast pace of the movement of product around the world, the increase of the number of units and creating a new inventory and purchasing approach that is as only ""as needed"" or delivered overnight.   perishable products that were never available in the united states or other parts of the world can now be sent overnight across the world, thus introducing products to people that have never before been available.  foodsevice & hospitality:  this makes up mostly the ""professional"" sector of restaurants and hotels.   people that work on this side of the industry often disdain the ""retail"" sectors.   they work with primarily distributors and brokers and the like that deal with their segment of the foodservice and hospitalit sectors.   food products that are marketed and packaged to the foodservice and hospitality trade are obviously of a different standard than that of retail, so the decision makers in this facet of the business are often quite discriminating.  retail:  this is made up of grocery stores, convenience shops, vending machines, and specialty consumer based shops.   nowadays, the larger grocery chains are controlling more and more of their product from product sourcing to distribution to the sale to the end user.   ""mom & pop"" shops in the united states are falling out.  regulation: this is made up largely by the goverment and its different divisions, from federal to state and local.   it is also very controversial, as regultion changes can force changes throughout the industry and often very disputed by both professionals and the public alike.  likewise, the industry is often regulated by itself with various member associations and political groups that are controlled by various interest groups that advocate, regulate, certify and even lobby government, etc.   there is even an arm of the goverment and private sector that ""educates"" professionals and the public, sometimes in the interest of advocacy, or for trends and the like.  finance and credit:  there are indeed companies that specialize in financing the food sector, as well as doing credit analysis and legal matters, etc.   companies that are traded on the world's stock exchanges are a world to themeselves and are now competing with regional and domestic companies in the fastly ""globalizing"" economy.  education/ certification:  the rise of educated and certified chefs in the united states is incredible, as is the growth of schools and institutions.   they certainly vary in size and specialty, just like any secondary learning institution.  trade shows, publishing and media:   more convergence has occurred in this sector over the last few years.   trade shows like the fancy food show and the western foodservice & hospitality show are gaining more criticism it seems, as perhaps less persuasion.  broadline distributors are creating thier own shows, taking away from cross industry forums.  manufacturers are also trying to control their marketing representation and get the best bang for the buck, transferring this marketing promotion and cost to others, if need be.  therefore, deals are made for exclusives in large distribution companies, warehouse stores and the lie, where inventory warehoused and promotions and rebates are received at that level.   meanwhile television networks, trade associations and publishers are promoting new celebrity chefs, cookbooks, internet sites and so on.

Talk:Meat industry,"Scope, content, verification, POV","this article contains some questionable claims apparently based on opinion.  only two references are cited currently.  the article does not attempt to provide a reliable, informative, balanced encyclopedia entry on the meat industry.  instead, following a problematic, four-sentence introduction, the article is wholly devoted to criticism and alternatives.  thus the newly resurrected article appears again (as it did until blanked in may 2005) simply as a vehicle for promoting an anti-meat-industry advocacy agenda.  this is not an objection to inclusion of criticism, but the criticism should be in the form of verified claims based on scholarly review, and when such criticism is included, the article as a whole should be recognizable as a genuine encyclopedia entry on the topic, rather than merely a pretext for presenting the criticism.  in the article’s opening sentence, the description of the meat industry is inaccurate in several respects.  it reveals  lack of familiarity with the topic and failure to consult credible sources to learn what is actually encompassed by the term “meat industry”.  regarding the meat industry, there is an abundance of credible information readily available on the internet from government agencies, the fao, review papers in the refereed journal literature, industry associations, etc.  these could have been consulted to prepare an informative, balanced article, which could encompass such topics as history of the industry, recent production statistics and economic role of the industry, industry structure, examples of the scope and nature of regulation governing the industry in some countries, major food safety considerations (including inspection and testing practices, adoption of haccp, development of traceability systems, food recall systems, biosecurity, etc.), some aspects of international trade, industry concentration issues (including some examples of cr4s and/or hhis), etc.  at present, none of these topics is addressed.  a pov tag is needed.  because the present article appears to use wikipedia simply as an advocacy platform and does not provide a genuine encyclopedia entry on the meat industry, it does not serve the best interests of wkipedia and its readers, considering the scope of the “meat industry” as that term tends to be used by government agencies, by the industry itself, and by many others, blanking the page (again, as in 2005) and redirecting to “meat packing industry” could be an acceptable option. if the article does not soon undergo substantial improvement, in terms of characterizing the topic and providing appropriate article scope with verified content, that option should be pursued.

Talk:Music industry,Toning down business section bias,"the business structure section contains a paragraph about the sale of sound recordings and how this translates into royalties for artists. prior to my edits of 10 and 13 sep 2009, this aspect of the music industry was characterized too simply. by failing to mention that the labels' revenues from sales of sound recordings are not ""royalties"", and that the disbursement of actual royalties from such sales depends on the contracts artists have with labels, the reader is misled into accepting the romantic notion that ''all'' artists receive royalties from ''any'' sales of the sound recordings they participated in, which is untrue — some recordings are ""works for hire"" for which the artist receives no royalties whatsoever, and more commonly, contracts with artists (such as one i have, myself) require a minimum level of sales to recoup the label's investment before the artists are entitled to any royalties. furthermore, the vast majority of sound recordings generate little or no revenue, as demonstrated by prs chief economist will page's recent article refuting the 'long tail' theory as it applies to online music sales.[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5380304.ece] that is, sales correspond to popularity, and the popular recordings are only a small portion of those available. thus it's improper to imply that ''all'' recordings generate revenues, let alone royalties. imho such oversimplifications indicate bias, perhaps unintentional, in favor of the labels and publishers who stand to gain from it.  that's why i made the following edits, which were soon reverted by [[user:david t tokyo|""david t tokyo""]]: * ''when cds sell…part of the money is returned to the performers in the form of royalties'' is an example i changed, as per the above rationale, so it doesn't cut out the very important middleman, the record label. i changed it to ''when cds sell…part of the money is returned to the sound recording copyright owners — the record companies — who may, depending on the agreements they have with the performers, share a portion of that money with the performers in the form of royalties.'' * an anonymous visitor changed ''most recordings ''only earn royalties'' for a short period after they are released.'' to ''most recordings ''generate substantial revenues'' for a short period after they are released.'' the edit summary said ''previous version…made it sound like royalties stopped being paid after a short period of time which is not true.'' i see how the change does alleviate the stated concern, but it resulted in the statement ''most recordings generate substantial revenues'' which is, as i mentioned above, insufficient. i changed it to ''most recordings, if they generate substantial revenues, generate them only for a short period after they are released.'' * the clause ''after which the song becomes part of the ""back catalogue"" or library'' was grammatically incorrect due to disagreement in number (recordings vs. song), and didn't explain what being in the ""back catalogue"" means, economically. i changed it to a separate sentence: ''afterward, the songs become part of the ""back catalogue"" or library, where they become candidates for future re-release, such as on compilations or licensed for use in film or television.'' * this pair of sentences was somewhat awkward: ''a much smaller number of recordings have become ""classics"", with longstanding popularity, such as albums by the beatles or the rolling stones. these albums have continued to earn royalties for the surviving band members decades after their original release date.'' the second sentence is really just referring to the beatles and rolling stones albums, but it's too easy to read it as meaning that artists get royalties from ''all'' classic albums. again this is just an example of painting with too broad a brush, probably not even intentionally, and my attempt to improve it by replacing ''surviving band members'' with ''record companies'' (although i forgot to change ''royalties'' to ''revenues'') shouldn't be regarded as disingenuous. * lastly, the [[itunes]] brand & software isn't quite the same thing as the [[itunes store]] online music vendor, so i replaced mentions of itunes with itunes store. this shouldn't have been blindly reverted along with my other edits.  i went ahead and re-did my edits, adjusted a bit and incorporating ""david t tokyo""'s additional fixes, but omitting my back-catalogue clarification, so the paragraph now reads as follows: ''when cds sell in stores or on websites such as the itunes store, part of the money obtained by the record label for the sales may be paid to the performers in the form of royalties. of the recordings which generate substantial revenues for the labels, most do so only for a short period after they are released, after which the song becomes part of the label's ""back catalogue"" or library. a much smaller number of recordings have become ""classics"", with longstanding popularity, such as cds by the beatles or the rolling stones. these albums have continued to generate revenue for the labels and often, in turn, royalties for artists, long after their original release.''  of course the fact remains that this entire section is mostly uncited. that shouldn't be used as an excuse to retain inaccurate and misleading generalizations. the entire article is fair game for continued improvement, and the addition of citations is part of that. i will devote as much time as i can to seeking out references where necessary. if there are specific claims that anyone feels need attributions more than others, please tag them as needing citations so i can give them higher priority. thanks! —[[user:mjb|mjb]] ([[user talk:mjb|talk]])","07:14, 14 september 2009"

(1) consumer electronics, such as digital music players, at 100 billion or so i think. they pay 0% to musicians. (2) radio advertising, which i would think is about 15 or 20 billion, which pays less than 1% to record companies (and, if you count independent promoters, they actually ''charge'' musicians money). if you add in live music (at around 20 billion) you get a number close what 168 billion. some of these (consumer electronics, live music) are increasing in value, so that would explain why this info graphic reports an increase. but the lion's share of this increase is in consumer electronics. i think it's hardly fair to count ""consumer electronics"" as part of the music industry to give the impression that the music industry is increasing in value. if there's no musician in the money chain, it's not the music industry, as far as i'm concerned.  of course, i am speculating about the source of these numbers, and i could be wrong. there's no way to tell, because (ironically) the full article is not freely downloadable. they want to get paid. ironic and hypocritical. ---- [[user:charlesgillingham|charlesgillingham]] ([[user talk:charlesgillingham|talk]])","05:39, 20 june 2012"

Talk:Music industry,Doubtful,"i removed this section, because it simply isn't true:{{quote| in addition to these traditional business relationships, new ways of doing business are being developed in the 2000s. technology, such as music production software and the internet has had an enormous impact on how music is created and distributed. in the 1970s and 1980s, if a pop or rock band wanted to make a recording, they had to go to a professional [[recording studio]] to have the recording made, and then get a record label to market and distribute physical copies of the lp, tape, or in the 1980s, the cd. during that same time period, if a contemporary [[classical music|classical]] composer wanted to have a score and musical parts for her new [[symphony]] prepared, she would have to go to a music publishing company which had the capability to prepare professional scores and parts.[[doubtful]] in the 2000s, a band can record an album using a usb mic and a high-end laptop with a digital recording software such as [[garageband]] and then sell digital copies online through the band's website. in the 2000s, a symphony composer can prepare a professional-level score and parts herself using digital score-writing software such as [[finale (software)|finale]]. }}  there are several problems: #you can't create professional level recordings in a bedroom with a usb mike -- you need to either (1) be a great engineer and producer, or (2) hire a great engineer and producer. e.g., to make a recording with a great ""pocket"", you need someone who knows how to tweak the kick drum until it makes the listener's head move. this is not something that garageband can do automatically (at least, not yet).  top producer/engineers (think [[dr. dre]] or [[steve lillywhite]]) are highly paid because they can do things that no one else can do, and they are not available in the average bedroom. recording isn't cheap, even with digital technology. digital technology has replaced the 24 track studor tape machine, but this was never the expensive part of recording. the expensive part is expertise. #the average musician can't make a living selling recordings on your website. the only artists that i am aware of who can generate a comfortable income this way are artists who established themselves by other means, or semi-professional artists who rely on resources other than their music. you need real marketing, promotion and distribution if you expect to quit your day job. you need the itunes store, a manager, a relationship with a people who know marketing, a relationship with radio promoters and pockets deep enough to pay all these people. you can do it without a record company, but in the real world, this is expensive. you still need someone to loan you the money. #recording artists (in the traditional system) needed to have a record deal ''before'' they went in the studio. unless they're rich. the record company paid the (aforementioned) producer and engineer. #a composer used to send his score to a [[copyist]] to get parts, not a publishing company. and yes, ""copyist"" is no longer a profession, because composer can now create the parts on the office printer and bring them into the studio. (but again, ""copying"" was not the hard part of writing, performing and recording a symphony -- this is not where most of the time or money is going.) the publishing company makes sure the composer gets paid if they're composition is used by anyone else, and nothing has changed there.  this is an article about the music industry, that is, people who make a living from music. this paragraph is wishful thinking, about a ""future of music"" that hasn't happened and isn't likely to happen any time soon. ---- [[user:charlesgillingham|charlesgillingham]] ([[user talk:charlesgillingham|talk]])","04:49, 3 august 2016"
Talk:Music industry,Bad Math,"hi guys, the % change column of the total revenue by year table in the stats section makes absolutely no sense and is completely inaccurate from a year to year perspective. going from $14.97 billion to $15 billion is not a 3.2% change, and decreasing from $18.8 billion to $18.4 billion is not an 8% decrease. i would change them immediately but i want to make sure that i haven't missed something completely. the odd part is that the sources agree with the stated percentages while also agreeing with the stated revenues. i'm very confused, but i think the hard revenue numbers hold more weight year to year, so i'll adjust the percentages to match later unless anyone has any objections.
