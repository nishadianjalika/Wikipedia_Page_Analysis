Talk:Arms industry,Article expansion,"I work in Security Assistance in dealing with Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and have attended class at the Defense Institute for Security Assistance Management (DISAM), but that doesn't make me an expert yet.  It really is a complex organization with stringent directives, much of which is outlined in the Secretary of Defense Instruction titled (currently) ''Joint Security Assistance Training Manual'' (JSAT), and the soon to be completed JSET which will replace the JSAT.  Let's face it, the world is not a safe place.  There are many reasons that we share our weapons, technology and practices (training) with other countries.  We share this with our allies to ensure that if and when we go into battle with them, we may have a better coordinated fight.  We give things to other countries as a gesture of good will.  Another very important part that is commonly overlooked is that when International Military Students come to the U.S. to train, they get to see the U.S. for what it really is, and can take their (hopefully pleasant) experiences home with them to share with their friends and families.  Since it is not uncommon for a [[Head of State]] have served in their nations military, there is a chance that they may have attended training in the U.S.  This is in fact the case with King [[Abdullah II]] of [[Jordan]].  Another thing to be looked at is countries that we may have obligations (under treaties) to defend, such is the case with [[Japan]] and the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea).  If they purchase our technology (and the training to use it), it may partially relieve our responsibilities.  However, this article surely needs to be expanded.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) is extremely important.  There should be separate articles for FMS, IMET, DCS, DISAM, International Military Student Officer (IMSO) (my job), Naval Education and Training Security Assistance Field Activity (NETSAFA), U.S. Army Security Assistance Training Field Activity (SATFA), Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), Security Assistance Officer (SAO) among others.

Talk:Arms industry,Contradiction (since removed),"<blockquote> The values in the Top Arms Exporters table seems to be completely wrong.  The total of the top arms exporters for 2006 is $1.2Billion, whereas the article also states ""From 1989 to 1996, the global value of direct commercial arms sales was US$257 billion, of which 45% was exported from the US"".  ($257/8 years = $32B/year, so unless the arms trade dropped by a factor of 25 in the next decade, those numbers are incorrect.)  The cited sources also give different values.  I added the contradiction flag at the top of the article, and added a sentence above the table telling people to go to the sources instead.

Talk:Arms industry,Invalid criticism of the United States,"A large part of this piece seems to be an attempt to slander the United States and does not objectively look at arms sales worldwide. No mention is made of other major arms exporters in the same light... small arms exports are mentioned, but based on the article one would think that the United States is the primary supplier of small arms, when in fact it is Russia (whose AK-47 is the most widely produced assault weapon). I recommend that arms sales specifically related to the United States be moved to a new article titled, ""Arms Sales of the United States,"" and then that article broken down into sections where criticisms such as the ones that exist in this article can be put into proper context. :: Let's get it straight and speak only the truth.  What make people hate the States?  Here is an example.  Tell me what is wrong with this: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture-e.html Harold Pinter The Nobel Prize in Literature 2005]  And then there's this: ""The United States is by far the largest exporter of weapons in the world, with a sales volume that exceeds the next 14 countries combined. Military sales equate to about 18 percent of the Federal budget, far and away the greatest proportion of any nation."" This is ridiculous! 18% of the $2.2 trillion federal budget (FY 2006) is $396 billion, yet according to SIPRI total arms sales worldwide totalled a maximum of $53 billion for 2004, with the United States making up approx. half of that.  ""According to the 2005 annual US congress reports, 58% of all US arms trade contracts are made with developing countries."" This is especially misleading, because nowhere in the article does it cite that Russia is the largest exporter of arms to the developing world. (Source: CDI, ""U.S. Arms Still Dominate International Market, Russia Leader to Developing World"" Nov 15, 2006)  In summary, it seems that the intention of this article is to slander the United States by misleading the reader by using an extremely selective use of sources and ""facts"" that do not hold up to any kind of scrutiny. I recommend the United States be removed from this article entirely and be given its own entry. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/215.65.50.34|215.65.50.34]] ([[User talk:215.65.50.34|talk]]) 08:46, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --> ::In fact the world won't be save while people like you still live.

Who says that it can go from one to the other in very little time. Let's be honest here. This is a slam against the USA and if we take it as that, it is factually incorrect on account that the ""Axis of Evil"" included North Korea and the United State's relations with North Korea have pretty clear since the Korean War.

The contention seems to be that Israel publishes no ""official"" figures about its arms exports. What a surprise. Well ""official"" figures from any source with a vested interest/agenda are suspect, even when the source is verified.  I suggest that such articles as the Ha'aretz article cited above are the best sources for verification that Israel is indeed a very major worldwide arms exporter.  We can also look at the publicly published export figures for the huge multi-national Rafael, one of Israel's (and the world's) largest weapons manufacturers, to get some inkling that Israel should be bumped way up in the Wiki list of world's largest arms exporters, even if ""official"" Israeli sources (the mossad or Shin Bet perhaps?) are not prepared to admit same.

Talk:Arms industry,AK-47 and Other Misunderstandings,"The [[AK-47]] is the most widely-copied weapon in the world and, according to the Russians, who would very much like a larger piece of the action, most are made illegally by nations and private enterprises which don't pay a license fee to the Russian patent holder. So equating numbers of AK-47s with any sort of Russian dominance seems hasty at best. Even with developing countries, more than two thirds of Russian transfers were to China and India, economic powerhouses in their own right and major military and nuclear powers besides. Is it fair to equate these two nations with countries such as Uganda or Nigeria?  Moreover, Russian exports are steadily declining, and EU and Israeli exports increasing, so statistics given for a range of years, especially in the past, may misstate the instantaneous, or even annual figures for the countries mentioned. See the current SIPRI report, among others.  It's also hard to equate the numbers released by the various agencies cited in both the main article and in these comments with reality, since terms of art, apples and oranges comparisons, and outright obfuscation mar most of them. Sales to developing nations are not the same as the arms trade in its entirety, since a large part of US output, for example, goes to developed countries. Canada, for example, buys from us, as do Taiwan, Australia, and many others, and all the official reports very clearly state that they reveal only unclassified information, so we must suppose that CIA-mediated and other clandestine transfers don't show up in the statistics. In the end, the article relies on the informed guesswork of SIPRI and other organizations with somewhat less of an agenda and/or political mandate than many official government agencies.  The SIPRI report cited is actually last year's edition, and has been superceded by the 2006 version here: [http://yearbook2006.sipri.org/  SIPRI Yearbook 2006]  [http://www.l-3com.com/ L-3 Communications] makes the sighting systems for weapons, as well as logistical support systems for military operations, so excluding it from the list, in this era of subcontractors taking on tiny bits of each finished product, seems slightly obsessive. One could easily carry this to extremes, and exclude the manufacturers of explosives, for example, because they have to be packed into a bomb in order to qualify as a weapon, or bullets, because they don't become weapons of war until fired from a gun at another human being. Indeed, there are those who use AK-47s to hunt deer and other game, so perhaps many of these so-called assault rifles are actually intended for jolly bands of huntsmen, out to shoot ducks or quail.  Likewise [[Carlyle Group]] profits from or substantially owns several defense companies. Are the owners of a business somehow not responsible for what they produce? Even if the relative amount of Carlyle capital invested in weapons contractors is minor? One notes that Aerospace & Defense are specialties, while plowshares are not. Not much money in the latter, one must suppose. [[User:Lee-Anne|Lee-Anne]] 14:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)  :Mikhail Kalashnikov never patented the design for the AK47, hence until 1999 there was nothing illegal about other nations building their own versions or even exact copies.

Talk:Arms industry,New Attempts at Politicizing,"I am dismayed to see some new edits that are injecting politics into this wiki-article.  What, pray tell, does ""small arms-conflicts"" mean?  Clearly, this is a fabricated political term of art invented by hoplophobes. The statistic quoted from the Oxfam report is meaningless.  No modern war is fought entirely with small arms.  Statistically, most casualties are caused by aerial bombs, artillery shells, mortars, and rockets, NOT small arms.  THERE ARE NO  ""small arms-conflicts"", but there ARE conflicts that include the use of small arms.   To assign the aggregate death toll to a weapons system that is in fact has a minority causal relationship, and then give a name attributing the deaths wholly TO that system is intellectually dishonest, at best, and political strong-arming at worst. In the early 21st Century, perhaps the only ""conflicts"" that take place entirely with small arms are fought by urban street gangs.  So, with a high degree of certainly, the cited annual death toll in the hundreds of thousands is specious.  Unless or until a less blatantly-biased source can be cited, this politicized statistical detrius from the Oxfam politicos should be removed from the article..  [[User:Trasel|Trasel]] ([[User talk:Trasel|talk]]) 04:30, 5 June 2009 (UTC)  * If editors want to assert facts, they must provide citations.

How can you accuse me of injecting opinion into the article, when all that I'm trying to do is delete some unsubstantiated balderdash another editor inserted?

The development of railroads and technological advances in refrigerated maritime transport subsequently enable bananas to become the most traded fruit in the world. The bananas were given a resistance gene from either a wild relative or a nematode. In 2012, the researchers planted their transgenic bananas, along with unmodified controls, at a farm about 40 kilometers southeast of Darwin, Australia, where Panama disease arrived 20 years ago. Banana is an economically important cash crop as it fetches large revenue share in the domestic and international market. However, most of the production is consumed by the domestic population as it serves as the staple food for them. In the article Genetically modified bananas: To mitigate food security concerns,[1] bananas are vulnerable to both biotic and abiotic stress factors which limits their production. Improvement of this crop to enhance the nutrient quality and better adapt to the changing environmental conditions and to produce new disease resistant varieties is essential. Genetically modified organisms produced using scientific methods include recombinant DNA technology and reproductive cloning. The article Genetically Modified Organism[2] explains the importance in GMOs and the safety of them. Genetically modified organisms provide certain advantages to producers and consumers. Modified plants, for example, can at least initially help protect crops by providing resistance to a specific disease or insect, ensuring greater food production. GMOs are also important sources of medicine.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class=""autosigned"">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Emarieva|Emarieva]] ([[User talk:Emarieva#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Emarieva|contribs]]) 17:11, 2 November 2020 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->"

Talk:Construction,Undue prominence on safety,"Hi [[User:Dustfreeworld]]. You recently reverted a change I made to keep safety within a section about characteristics of of the construction industry. You assert ""Safety is not a “characteristic” of the industry. It’s a big problem caused by and also affecting the construction industry.""  Previous edits of the construction article have created a logical hierarchy of four main headings: History, Sectors, Processes, Scale and characteristics. The latter's subsections included Economic activity, Employment, Sustainability, and (until you removed it) Safety. I do not share your view that this should be added to a main section of its own. Indeed, arguably, (a lack of) sustainability is an even greater problem with causes by and impacts upon the construction sector. I think the change you made warrants further discussion here with other editors to establish a consensus for your move. You clearly have a strong interest in air and dust pollution-related matters, but, in my view, your focus on these areas is potentially skewing the construction article by making safety more prominent than other issues ([[WP:Undue]]).  I propose to revert the change and invite you to discuss it here on the article Talk page.

[[User:Tarchon|Tarchon]] 22:13, 9 May 2007 (UTC)  :::Fuel cells are like batteries in that they convert chemical energy to electrical energy, but they are different because batteries rely on chemicals built into the cell, while fuel cells consume fuel provided by an external source. I could see fuel cells being included, because eventually they may have a role in commercial electric generation, but batteries have no potential for such use, due to their high cost. (In principle, rechargeable batteries could be used to store energy for use during times of high demand, or to replace solar and wind energy at night or when the wind is calm, but as far as I know, this is not done except in small installations that are not connected to the grid.) --[[User:Gerry Ashton|Gerry Ashton]] 23:09, 9 May 2007 (UTC)  :::: [http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/archive.cfm/pubDate=%7Bd%20'2003-09-24'%7D#6490 World's Largest Utility Battery System Installed in Alaska] ''""13,670 nickel-cadmium battery cells to generate up to 40 megawatts of power for about 7 minutes, or 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes.""'' ie: 6.75 mW for an hour, 0.28 mW for a day.  Compare that to the 0.25 megawatt fuel cell installation mentioned above it, it's hydrogen must be generated somehow and at a substantial loss in the [[Fuel_cell#Efficiency|cyclic efficiency]] of about 25% (H2O+electricity -> H2 -> H20+electricity) where as batteries range from [[Battery_%28electricity%29#Conversion_to_energy|66% to 99%]].  Batteries have their place, but I don't consider fuel cells nor batteries electricity generation technology.  They are both electricity storage technologies, one far more expensive and inefficient, that being fuel cells. --[[User:D0li0|D0li0]] 07:17, 10 May 2007 (UTC)  Sometimes fuel cell hydrogen is generated by water electrolysis, but fuel cells can and do use hydrocarbon fuels from a variety of sources. Plus, some schemes use hydrogen extracted from hydrocarbon fuels rather than from water. I think drawing a line between ""storage"" and ""generation"" is pretty artificial anyway. By the storage criterion, I could argue that coal fired power plants should be excluded because they aren't generating electricity. The energy in coal was stored by plants 200 million years ago, after all. If you can hook a voltmeter up to it and the needle moves, it's generating electricity. [[User:Tarchon|Tarchon]] 17:26, 10 May 2007 (UTC)  : Perhaps you are right, both batteries and fuel cells do generate or produce electricity.  I do consider coal, oil, and natural gas stored solar energy, so strictly speaking the stars are the only energy generators in the universe.  All the more reason to use the most direct forms of solar energy (Heat, PV, Wind, Hydro).  Even the heavy atoms in nuclear fuels are solar byproducts.  Having been burning fossil fuels so intensively for the last century we are in effect reversing the photosynthetic processes that occurred over the past hundreds of millennium, essentially reversing the time/age/balance of the earth natural systems, which seems like a pretty dangerous experiment to me.  Anyway, I'm not sure if there's a point other than if a fuel cell section is added then I would also be inclined to add a battery section.  --[[User:D0li0|D0li0]] 18:35, 10 May 2007 (UTC)  ::The lead paragraph of the article clearly indicates the article is about commercial electric generation, which would exclude off-grid small scale electric generation, such as generators in automobiles, batteries used in portable devices (e.g. iPods), etc. It might be useful to put links to articles about small-scale generation in the See also section, if there are any such articles.  ::Considering the new information about use of batteries by a utility, I suppose that could go in this article. --[[User:Gerry Ashton|Gerry Ashton]] 18:40, 10 May 2007 (UTC) ::: Batteries are just as commercial as power plants. Duracell isn't giving them away after all. I get the sense that the original article was intended to be about utility power generation, but if the article was supposed to be about that, that's what it should have been called. If an article has a generic title like ""electricity generation,"" it should be about electricity generation in general, not just the particular type of electricity generation that the original contributor had in mind. When I wrote the ""Other Methods"" section I hadn't been thinking about fuel cells, but that doesn't necessarily imply that they shouldn't be in there. I think the important thing in the ""Other Methods"" is to point out that there are a lot of different technologies for generating electricity and to provide links to the various types for more information, along with some brief and broad description of their respective roles in the world. [[User:Tarchon|Tarchon]] 20:34, 10 May 2007 (UTC)  Mention of batteries and fuel cells do not belong in this article.  They are not methods of power generation, they are methods of chemical energy storage and transfer.  Power generation is the transfer of mechanical energy to electromagnetic energy.

And what do you mean by ""efficiency""? What are you wanting to learn from the answer?  Saying that a solar panel is about 11% efficient at converting sunlight to electricity and a combined-cycle gas-turbine plant is 59% efficient at converting natural gas to electricity looks like information, but what really does it tell you? A hydro turbine may be 95% efficent at converting energy of falling water to electricity. I think it's only useful to compare efficiencies for the same primary energy source; then there's a correlation between efficiency and capital and operating costs. But you shouldn't compare apples and oranges, let alone apples and shiny round rocks. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 14:50, 20 February 2008 (UTC)  Hi, just wanted to suggest updating the photovoltaic efficiency to 47% from 40%.

[[User:Attoman|Attoman]] ([[User talk:Attoman|talk]]) 01:57, 29 April 2008 (UTC) ::Wikipedia already has a [[Solar power satellite]] article. The [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}]] article cannot cover every possible technology for generating electricity. Even the individual sub-articles such as [[Solar energy]] and [[Wind power]] get so long that we have to split them up too. However, [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}]] could use a [[WP:NAVBOX|navigation template]] which would direct the reader to more details on the various technologies for generating electricity. The main drawback of solar power satellite technology is the enormous time and investment necessary before it could yield any power, when we already have plenty of unused [[desert]] land and rooftops on which to install solar collectors much more quickly, and above all incrementally, with proven technology. There is almost always a huge difference between proven and unproven technologies. With a proven technology, the costs and time requirements are knowable with high confidence. With unproven technologies, the actual costs and time requirements may differ enormously from preliminary estimates. That's why private investors greatly prefer proven technologies, whereas only governments are typically able to gamble large sums on unproven technologies. Time may become extremely important if the dire predictions of [[peak oil]] proponents bear out (see for example the [[Hirsch report]]) - e.g., once the full scale of the liquid fuel shortage becomes clear (in the worst-case scenario of petroleum depletion), civilization may lack the time and fossil energy resources necessary to mount a huge program of space power development.

Furthermore, since the changes were made to make this article more about film industry (instead of unrelated things related to film), it included cutting things that really didn't belong here, but are suited for the specific articles where the original text was cut from.

[http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=55&lang=en The source chart] contains data for only 61 countries (the other two-thirds presumably could not be accurately surveyed and so were left blank), making it a poor basis for an ordered list implicitly presenting itself as a ""top 10"" list.  For instance, all data for India is missing in [http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=55&lang=en the source chart]. However, the very next chart down on the same website ([http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=56&lang=en ""Cinema infrastructure - Capacity""]), while also incomplete and using different metrics, DOES have data for India and shows that India recently had almost twice as many screens as France. (Not surprising, given India's massive film industry and population.) Meanwhile, [[Film_industry#Number_of_Indoor_Cinemas|Wikipedia's list]], being based on incomplete data, shows France in 2nd place with India nowhere to be seen.

India (a country ranking at or near the top of all the other charts) is one of many countries missing from the ""Number of indoor cinemas"" data set for 2013, as are China, Russia, Nigeria, and other countries with significant film industries. We can't guess how the missing data would change the presumed country rankings. The point is that the rankings and ""top countries"" presentation of the data are not part of the original data set, and basing a ranked list on a data set with half the candidates missing is a mistaken interpretation of that data. [[WP:SYNTHESIS]] states: ""do not combine different parts of one source to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by the source."" The guideline exists to guard against mistakes like this. This is not a critique of the source itself or its reliability. The UNESCO data could be legitimately used to support statements like ""As of 2013, there were approximately 2,025 indoor cinemas in France."" But it could not be used to claim, for instance, that ""France has the second greatest number of indoor cinemas of all countries in the world."" Like the charts above, that would imply information not explicitly contained in the source, and would likely be wrong.

Talk:Fishing industry,Stub,"I think this article should be labelled as a stub. There was more in the fishing article than this one. I think we should emphasise the importance of the increase of coastal territory of coastal countries worldwide to 20 nautical miles implemented by the United Nations. It is important because countries wanted more control over their continental shelves to prevent foreign trawlers from destroying their ecosystems and thus their fisheries. For Canada it came too late. Our Atlantic Canada's most important fish, cod, became illegal to fish in 1992 due to critically low populations. That resulted in an economic collapse in the maritime provinces. I would add all this but I can't source it at the moment. If anyone else can feel free.  what about including links to fish farming. increasingly inland production of ocean life is changing where we get our food, i know shrimp, crawfish, catfish, salmon, and mussels are commonly grown in tanks or in flooded fields now"

Talk:Food industry,General Format & Topics Suggestions,"I came across this page when looking up a discussion on ""food processing.""   It was redirrected to ""Food Industry.""   I see it here as a sub-topic.  As a food industry professional, who has gone on to be a chef, I would suggest that some changes should be made to reflect more how the industry actually operates.   I understand the page was started with a quick outline some time ago, but I think some things should be re-formated.  Here's some examples of the different segments of the industry:   Farms/ Growers  Food Manufacturers (namely smaller independent, regional or national companies)  Food Conglomerates(namely multinational or global enterprises that represent the new economy and control more aspects of the total product, from production, packaging, marketing, distribution, etc.)  Disosable supply manufacturers: they make everything from napkins, food containers, plastic forks and knives, plastic and aluminum wraps, chef hats, etc.  Light equipment manufacturers:  they make everything from ceramic platewares, glassware, cooking utensils, tableware, pots and pans, etc.  Heavy equipment manufacturers: they make everything from stoves, steamers, ventilation hoods, preparation tables, etc.  Industrial equipment and machine manufacturers:  they make the equipments and machines that help produce and process any food items, from agriculture to meat industry and to canning and beyond.  Distributors:  These are made up of smaller local, regional and national companies.  There are also specialized distributors, broadliners, master-distributors and re-distributors.  Not only that, but distribution is often split between retail and wholesale/ foodservice.   Broadliners try to do everything, but many companies are select in things like dry goods, alcohol, cleaning supplies, meats, produce, etc.   Street salesman are less numerous in these companies nowadays, as companies push sales to the internet, telephone and the the like.  Brokers: These people traditionaly represent the manufacturere or conglomerates and have more than one company that they promote.   They act like the liason between the  manufacturers and the distributors, for instance.  Their primary objective is to move major units; i.e., by the pallet or truckloads.   But they often help sales teams target end users in either restaurants or retail.   They often have the advertising materials and promotions, either in material form or even negotiated dollar rebates.  In the past years, brokers have seen an attack against their role in the industry as companies consolidate lines, promote more on the internet and re-organize the distribution of product through laterally, totally integrated companies.  Importers and Exporters:  The United States probably relies on imported goods than many other compmanies.   We have both a national cuisine and a tradition of imported foods.   This segment leads both into retail and wholesale/ foodservice, but is an enormous segment to itself.  Companies are licensed and specialized solely in importing and exporting, although some act like master distributors and importers of various product lines.   Aside, from that, this segment of the industry has its own sets of regulations and also relies on the ocean going shipping industry or cross-border trade routes, either by train or truck, to Mexico and Canada.  Europe and other places are now organized under their European Union, under a common currency and new trade laws.  Transportation, Freight forwarding and logistics:   This segment crosses over into categories, but is really a growing influential enterprise that stands somewhat independent and yet supports the food industry itself.  The trend is to ""trace"" product from its very original source to its movenent into the network and out to the end user.  For example, Niman Ranch meat products is a leader in ""tracing"" every piece of meat that goes out.  But this industry works with everyone, from manufacturers, to distributors, to importers and beyond.   It was traditionally about ""carriers"" and paper bill of ladings and other documents, but nowadays this segment of the industry is forcing technology into the process, eliminating actual ""paper"" to the digital preferance.   It is also increasing the fast pace of the movement of product around the world, the increase of the number of units and creating a new inventory and purchasing approach that is as only ""as needed"" or delivered overnight.   Perishable products that were never available in the United States or other parts of the world can now be sent overnight across the world, thus introducing products to people that have never before been available.  Foodsevice & Hospitality:  This makes up mostly the ""professional"" sector of restaurants and hotels.   People that work on this side of the industry often disdain the ""retail"" sectors.   They work with primarily distributors and brokers and the like that deal with their segment of the foodservice and hospitalit sectors.   Food products that are marketed and packaged to the foodservice and hospitality trade are obviously of a different standard than that of retail, so the decision makers in this facet of the business are often quite discriminating.  Retail:  This is made up of grocery stores, convenience shops, vending machines, and specialty consumer based shops.   Nowadays, the larger grocery chains are controlling more and more of their product from product sourcing to distribution to the sale to the end user.   ""Mom & Pop"" shops in the united states are falling out.  Regulation: This is made up largely by the goverment and its different divisions, from federal to state and local.   It is also very controversial, as regultion changes can force changes throughout the industry and often very disputed by both professionals and the public alike.  Likewise, the industry is often regulated by itself with various member associations and political groups that are controlled by various interest groups that advocate, regulate, certify and even lobby government, etc.   There is even an arm of the goverment and private sector that ""educates"" professionals and the public, sometimes in the interest of advocacy, or for trends and the like.  Finance and credit:  there are indeed companies that specialize in financing the food sector, as well as doing credit analysis and legal matters, etc.   Companies that are traded on the world's stock exchanges are a world to themeselves and are now competing with regional and domestic companies in the fastly ""globalizing"" economy.  Education/ Certification:  The rise of educated and certified chefs in the United States is incredible, as is the growth of schools and institutions.   They certainly vary in size and specialty, just like any secondary learning institution.  Trade shows, publishing and media:   more convergence has occurred in this sector over the last few years.   Trade shows like the Fancy Food Show and the Western Foodservice & Hospitality Show are gaining more criticism it seems, as perhaps less persuasion.  Broadline distributors are creating thier own shows, taking away from cross industry forums.  Manufacturers are also trying to control their marketing representation and get the best bang for the buck, transferring this marketing promotion and cost to others, if need be.  Therefore, deals are made for exclusives in large distribution companies, warehouse stores and the lie, where inventory warehoused and promotions and rebates are received at that level.   Meanwhile television networks, trade associations and publishers are promoting new celebrity chefs, cookbooks, internet sites and so on.

I would say that significant aspects are the creation of preserved and packaged food starting with things like [[jerky]], [[canning]], and [[jarring]] followed by commercialization and industrialization of these same items. It would seem that the food industry has grown as packaging has developed and evolved. Also, as controversial as it might be, there is the GMO aspect to consider in agriculture, from the earliest [[grafting]] of trees and combining of wheat strains thousands of years ago.  That said, everything that happened up until the 1700s with the advent of military rations can probably be summed up in a paragraph or so, then move on to a section about the Industrial Revolution and then later the advent of plastics and the affect it had on the food industry. --[[User:Scalhotrod|Scalhotrod]] [[User_talk:Scalhotrod|(Talk)]] ☮ღ☺ 01:31, 11 May 2015 (UTC)"

Talk:Meat industry,"Scope, content, verification, POV","This article contains some questionable claims apparently based on opinion.  Only two references are cited currently.  The article does not attempt to provide a reliable, informative, balanced encyclopedia entry on the meat industry.  Instead, following a problematic, four-sentence introduction, the article is wholly devoted to Criticism and Alternatives.  Thus the newly resurrected article appears again (as it did until blanked in May 2005) simply as a vehicle for promoting an anti-meat-industry advocacy agenda.  This is not an objection to inclusion of criticism, but the criticism should be in the form of verified claims based on scholarly review, and when such criticism is included, the article as a whole should be recognizable as a genuine encyclopedia entry on the topic, rather than merely a pretext for presenting the criticism.  In the article’s opening sentence, the description of the meat industry is inaccurate in several respects.  It reveals  lack of familiarity with the topic and failure to consult credible sources to learn what is actually encompassed by the term “meat industry”.  Regarding the meat industry, there is an abundance of credible information readily available on the internet from government agencies, the FAO, review papers in the refereed journal literature, industry associations, etc.  These could have been consulted to prepare an informative, balanced article, which could encompass such topics as history of the industry, recent production statistics and economic role of the industry, industry structure, examples of the scope and nature of regulation governing the industry in some countries, major food safety considerations (including inspection and testing practices, adoption of HACCP, development of traceability systems, food recall systems, biosecurity, etc.), some aspects of international trade, industry concentration issues (including some examples of CR4s and/or HHIs), etc.  At present, none of these topics is addressed.  A POV tag is needed.  Because the present article appears to use Wikipedia simply as an advocacy platform and does not provide a genuine encyclopedia entry on the meat industry, it does not serve the best interests of Wkipedia and its readers, Considering the scope of the “meat industry” as that term tends to be used by government agencies, by the industry itself, and by many others, blanking the page (again, as in 2005) and redirecting to “Meat packing industry” could be an acceptable option. If the article does not soon undergo substantial improvement, in terms of characterizing the topic and providing appropriate article scope with verified content, that option should be pursued.

Talk:Music industry,Toning down business section bias,"The business structure section contains a paragraph about the sale of sound recordings and how this translates into royalties for artists. Prior to my edits of 10 and 13 Sep 2009, this aspect of the music industry was characterized too simply. By failing to mention that the labels' revenues from sales of sound recordings are not ""royalties"", and that the disbursement of actual royalties from such sales depends on the contracts artists have with labels, the reader is misled into accepting the romantic notion that ''all'' artists receive royalties from ''any'' sales of the sound recordings they participated in, which is untrue — some recordings are ""works for hire"" for which the artist receives no royalties whatsoever, and more commonly, contracts with artists (such as one I have, myself) require a minimum level of sales to recoup the label's investment before the artists are entitled to any royalties. Furthermore, the vast majority of sound recordings generate little or no revenue, as demonstrated by PRS Chief Economist Will Page's recent article refuting the 'Long Tail' theory as it applies to online music sales.[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5380304.ece] That is, sales correspond to popularity, and the popular recordings are only a small portion of those available. Thus it's improper to imply that ''all'' recordings generate revenues, let alone royalties. IMHO such oversimplifications indicate bias, perhaps unintentional, in favor of the labels and publishers who stand to gain from it.  That's why I made the following edits, which were soon reverted by [[User:David T Tokyo|""David T Tokyo""]]: * ''When CDs sell…part of the money is returned to the performers in the form of royalties'' is an example I changed, as per the above rationale, so it doesn't cut out the very important middleman, the record label. I changed it to ''When CDs sell…part of the money is returned to the sound recording copyright owners — the record companies — who may, depending on the agreements they have with the performers, share a portion of that money with the performers in the form of royalties.'' * An anonymous visitor changed ''Most recordings ''only earn royalties'' for a short period after they are released.'' to ''Most recordings ''generate substantial revenues'' for a short period after they are released.'' The edit summary said ''Previous version…made it sound like royalties stopped being paid after a short period of time which is not true.'' I see how the change does alleviate the stated concern, but it resulted in the statement ''Most recordings generate substantial revenues'' which is, as I mentioned above, insufficient. I changed it to ''Most recordings, if they generate substantial revenues, generate them only for a short period after they are released.'' * The clause ''after which the song becomes part of the ""back catalogue"" or library'' was grammatically incorrect due to disagreement in number (recordings vs. song), and didn't explain what being in the ""back catalogue"" means, economically. I changed it to a separate sentence: ''Afterward, the songs become part of the ""back catalogue"" or library, where they become candidates for future re-release, such as on compilations or licensed for use in film or television.'' * This pair of sentences was somewhat awkward: ''A much smaller number of recordings have become ""classics"", with longstanding popularity, such as albums by the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. These albums have continued to earn royalties for the surviving band members decades after their original release date.'' The second sentence is really just referring to the Beatles and Rolling Stones albums, but it's too easy to read it as meaning that artists get royalties from ''all'' classic albums. Again this is just an example of painting with too broad a brush, probably not even intentionally, and my attempt to improve it by replacing ''surviving band members'' with ''record companies'' (although I forgot to change ''royalties'' to ''revenues'') shouldn't be regarded as disingenuous. * Lastly, the [[iTunes]] brand & software isn't quite the same thing as the [[iTunes Store]] online music vendor, so I replaced mentions of iTunes with iTunes Store. This shouldn't have been blindly reverted along with my other edits.  I went ahead and re-did my edits, adjusted a bit and incorporating ""David T Tokyo""'s additional fixes, but omitting my back-catalogue clarification, so the paragraph now reads as follows: ''When CDs sell in stores or on websites such as the iTunes Store, part of the money obtained by the record label for the sales may be paid to the performers in the form of royalties. Of the recordings which generate substantial revenues for the labels, most do so only for a short period after they are released, after which the song becomes part of the label's ""back catalogue"" or library. A much smaller number of recordings have become ""classics"", with longstanding popularity, such as CDs by the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. These albums have continued to generate revenue for the labels and often, in turn, royalties for artists, long after their original release.''  Of course the fact remains that this entire section is mostly uncited. That shouldn't be used as an excuse to retain inaccurate and misleading generalizations. The entire article is fair game for continued improvement, and the addition of citations is part of that. I will devote as much time as I can to seeking out references where necessary. If there are specific claims that anyone feels need attributions more than others, please tag them as needing citations so I can give them higher priority.

But these figures are selective and misleading. :Physical product sales are certainly in decline. Some pundits attribute the decline in music purchases to consumer disillusionment with a decline in quality and homogenization of music, but I haven't seen any compelling evidence to back that up. What I have seen reported is 1. less physical product is being made (arguably in response to declining sales), 2. there's increasing competition from other forms of entertainment (video and games, especially), 3. since the mid-2000s, people have been buying more digital product (downloads from web stores), and 4. a not-insignificant number of would-be customers resorted to piracy. :More recently, though, piracy and sales of both physical and digital product have been getting hit by 5. competition from streaming in all its forms (net radio, cloud storage, social music), both licensed and unlicensed (although digital sales are still up, apparently). You're right, these streaming services aren't as profitable for the industry as product sales, but I've seen reports that non-product-sales sources of revenue are more than making up for the decline in product sales (see below); so piracy is, arguably, a red herring, and the music industry is profiting more than ever. :It's OK to talk about piracy and shifts in what forms of music and other entertainment are responsible, but we shouldn't be saying anything in the article to make it seem like the music industry is collapsing and that it's all due to piracy.

There are also sources for how much money is being poured into tours and how that relates to artist income. :But if the goal is to get a clear idea of all of the income streams for a typical recording artist, composer or lyricist, I doubt such a thing has ever been published. Contracts between artists, labels, publishers and collection societies are generally private. Labels and publishers don't want people to know how much they're making off each artist, and famous artists ''really'' don't want their finances made public, especially if they partially rely on sources of income other than direct sales of their music. Occasionally some details will surface publicly, such as in the recent lawsuit by Kenny Rogers against Capitol, but that's focusing on issues orthogonal to what we're discussing. Still, might be worth looking into more closely. —[[User:Mjb|mjb]] ([[User talk:Mjb|talk]]) 08:12, 26 May 2012 (UTC)  ::The ""normal"" percentages paid to retail, radio, management, record companies, etc. are all widely known inside the industry.

Do you any of your sources provide proof of this? The reason I ask is that (I believe) that Pandora and Rhapsody pay only fractions of a penny per spin, a very very little of that shows up in the bank accounts of musicians. I'm (coincidentally) talking to Pandora about this at the moment and I should have hard numbers soon. ---- [[User:CharlesGillingham|CharlesGillingham]] ([[User talk:CharlesGillingham|talk]]) 08:48, 7 June 2012 (UTC)  :Thanks, but I think we're somewhat talking past each other, here.  :We agree that people are streaming more and buying less, and what they do buy isn't as profitable as the cash cow that was CDs in the '90s. And we agree that streaming is way less profitable than sales, and that it apparently doesn't offset the decline in revenue (although I'd like to see some aggregate numbers, not the oft-quoted per-listen or per-song figures, which ''of course'' aren't as profitable as downloads, why should they be?).  :In the article, there's a sequence of things that are said. To paraphrase: 1. Revenues for physical product and downloads of recorded music declined greatly from 1999 to 2008. 2. The industry has downsized and struggled to adjust. 3. One of the first things they did in this period was shut down a number of file-sharing services (Napster being the most famous one), and threatened thousands of individual file-sharers, but this didn't stop the decline in revenue.  :Now, you say this doesn't imply that the industry solely blames piracy for its decline in sales revenue, but I say it does. I don't see how you can read it otherwise. There's nothing about what one of the sources I mentioned calls the end of the digital “replacement cycle”, nothing about iPods, nothing about people buying tracks more than albums, nothing about people substituting purchases with streaming, nothing about people substituting purchases of music with non-music entertainment options (video games, DVDs/Blu-Ray, streaming video), nothing about people streaming music instead of buying, nothing about the fact that the music industry has other sources of revenue besides sales.  :The point of emphasizing that the IFPI's figures are for a very specific type of revenue stream (""sales, not streaming"") was not intended to suggest that the rise of streaming has appreciably compensated for the sales-revenue decline, or even to say that the industry's losses are overstated, although I do have my doubts (to the extent that they're selective about which figures they draw attention to, not the figures themselves). I was mainly just trying to downplay the subsequent emphasis on piracy—i.e., the arguably false implication that revenues are down solely because consumers are still getting music but have stopped paying for it, when in fact they've shifted their spending to a variety of options. Certainly there are those who engage in file-sharing of doubtful legality, but gobs of people are flocking to legal options...it's just that these legal alternatives to buying CDs simply do not have the profit margins of CD sales.  :Really, the article needs more than just a mention of streaming, in order to put sales-revenue figures in proper context. We need other metrics besides revenues, and a more complete picture of revenue sources than just sales. We also need a more thorough breakdown of what shifts are occurring in consumer spending. However, that's more than I have time for... :) —[[User:Mjb|mjb]] ([[User talk:Mjb|talk]]) 11:44, 7 June 2012 (UTC)  ::It's important to say this very precisely. First, '''many in the industry blame file sharing for the decline'''. This is simply a fact, and this article must report well-sourced facts. As you point out, the article implies this passively without saying it exactly. However, the article does ''not'' state that '''file sharing is the cause of the decline'''. This is not a fact, it is an opinion (and one which both you and I disagree with). There is even a sentence in the article that denies this opinion, despite the fact that this is very much a minority point of view.  ::To address your issues we could (1) Make sure we have the right aggregate numbers for streaming, digital downloads and physical media. (I am confident that this number will only differ by a few percent, but of course the article would be improved by the perfect number.) (2) Beef up the sentence that denies file sharing is the cause of the decline. Mention Job's letter and some of your sources. (To me, this post-game debate is somewhat pointless, but there's no reason not to give it another sentence.) (3) Add a bit more about how artists (especially older acts) have raised ticket prices and pushed merchandise harder to increase revenues. Note, however, that the big acts could have raised their prices in any decade, and they are only doing so now as a reaction to the decline in sales revenues. As such, it is not really relevant to a discussion of the severity or causes of the decline.  ::There is a simple, obvious and important story here. People stopped spending as much on recorded music, and the industry has had to change. This is the main point that the article needs to get across. The reasons they stopped spending money on recorded music are complicated and some of them are in dispute, but the main story is very simple.

Talk:Music industry,= Reading the sources =,"I finally found time to actually read through your sources above. I signed each of my comments below, so feel free to reply in-between.  :* [http://www.techdirt.com/skyisrising/ The Sky is Rising] - infographic + report This article claims that the value of the ""music industry"" is increasing. However, these numbers are either completely fictional or extremely misleading. The value of the worldwide ''recording'' industry (which is what we're discussing) is dropping, and is now in the 20-30 billion range -- nowhere near the 168 billion as this info-graphic states. The only way to get this number is to include two sectors that pay almost nothing to musicians. (1) Consumer electronics, such as digital music players, at 100 billion or so I think. They pay 0% to musicians. (2) Radio advertising, which I would think is about 15 or 20 billion, which pays less than 1% to record companies (and, if you count independent promoters, they actually ''charge'' musicians money). If you add in live music (at around 20 billion) you get a number close what 168 billion. Some of these (consumer electronics, live music) are increasing in value, so that would explain why this info graphic reports an increase. But the lion's share of this increase is in consumer electronics. I think it's hardly fair to count ""consumer electronics"" as part of the music industry to give the impression that the music industry is increasing in value. If there's no musician in the money chain, it's not the music industry, as far as I'm concerned.  Of course, I am speculating about the source of these numbers, and I could be wrong. There's no way to tell, because (ironically) the full article is not freely downloadable. They want to get paid. Ironic and hypocritical. ---- [[User:CharlesGillingham|CharlesGillingham]] ([[User talk:CharlesGillingham|talk]]) 05:39, 20 June 2012 (UTC) :* [http://www.economist.com/node/17199460?story_id=17199460 What's working in music - Having a ball - In the supposedly benighted music business, a lot of things are making money] - from ''The Economist'' This article explicitly describes the downturn, and places the blame on piracy, which is the opposite of the point I think you're trying to make. To quote:<blockquote>For the past ten years sales of recorded music have declined so steeply as to become a cautionary tale about the disruptive power of the internet. The rise of illegal file-sharing and the end of the digital “replacement cycle”, in which people bought CDs to replace tapes and records, caused spending to collapse. Sales of CDs, tapes and records have slid by 40% in Britain since 2001, according to the BPI, which represents record labels. In Japan, the world’s biggest CD sales market, the number of discs sold fell by 6% in 2008 and 24% in 2009. Price cuts meant that revenues dropped even more steeply.<br><br>  The rise in digital music-sales is scant compensation. People tend to buy tracks, not albums, from sites like Apple’s iTunes. They can obtain their favourite music much more cheaply than they could in the CD era. And even digital sales are now stalling.</blockquote> The article goes on to report on how revenues from live music and merchandise have increased, mostly because ticket prices for the big acts (U2, Gaga, etc.) have gone through the roof. As I said earlier, I think this is off-topic: the issue we are discussing is the decline in revenues for recorded music, not the increase in live music ticket prices. Live music obviously has no connection to piracy. (Unless you want to argue that the fact that I have two jobs means that I deserve to be paid less for my first job, which is nonsense.)  Having said that, I should say I'm happy to include a little more about the increase in revenue from live music, and maybe this even deserves it's own paragraph. This is a great citation for that. (We should probably also report that almost all of this new money is going from older people to a handful of well-established acts, and I would probably use [http://thetrichordist.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/meet-the-new-boss-worse-than-the-old-boss-full-post/ the Lowery article] as citation for this point.) ---- [[User:CharlesGillingham|CharlesGillingham]] ([[User talk:CharlesGillingham|talk]]) 05:39, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  :* [http://piracy.ssrc.org/the-report/ Media Piracy in Emerging Economies] - Chapter 1 discusses how industry stats are misleading and manipulated This is a really solid source.

The book also reports that research community has vastly improved its reliability over the decade.

The article (correctly, I think) points out that it wasn't ''the law'' that turned people away from piracy, it was ''the discussion of the law'' that turned people away from piracy. The music industry claimed that this study shows enforcement works; torrent freak correctly points out that this conclusion is unwarranted. However, it does show that ''discussing'' enforcement works. (They also make a speculative argument that jump might have something to do with Spotify's rise to power the previous year, the idea being that this dropped sales in other countries. This argument requires us to believe that, for some reason, the buzz on Spotify skipped France and that the buzz suddenly stopped, coincidentally, the same month Hadopi was debated.)  This is way too small a detail to be discussed in this article. At any rate, note that the article describes the enforcement option as a ""disaster"", so it is certainly not biased towards the music industry on the issue of enforcement. ---- [[User:CharlesGillingham|CharlesGillingham]] ([[User talk:CharlesGillingham|talk]]) 05:39, 20 June 2012 (UTC)  :* [http://torrentfreak.com/riaa-innovation-is-the-best-way-to-kill-piracy-120412/ RIAA: Innovation is the Best Way to Kill Piracy] This article questions whether the LimeWire shut down actually raised sales at iTunes, so it addresses the general issue of exactly how much money is lost to piracy.

Technology, such as music production software and the Internet has had an enormous impact on how music is created and distributed. In the 1970s and 1980s, if a pop or rock band wanted to make a recording, they had to go to a professional [[recording studio]] to have the recording made, and then get a record label to market and distribute physical copies of the LP, tape, or in the 1980s, the CD. During that same time period, if a contemporary [[classical music|classical]] composer wanted to have a score and musical parts for her new [[symphony]] prepared, she would have to go to a music publishing company which had the capability to prepare professional scores and parts.[[Doubtful]] In the 2000s, a band can record an album using a USB mic and a high-end laptop with a digital recording software such as [[Garageband]] and then sell digital copies online through the band's website. In the 2000s, a symphony composer can prepare a professional-level score and parts herself using digital score-writing software such as [[Finale (software)|Finale]]. }}  There are several problems: #You can't create professional level recordings in a bedroom with a USB mike -- you need to either (1) be a great engineer and producer, or (2) hire a great engineer and producer. E.g., to make a recording with a great ""pocket"", you need someone who knows how to tweak the kick drum until it makes the listener's head move. This is not something that GarageBand can do automatically (at least, not yet).  Top producer/engineers (think [[Dr. Dre]] or [[Steve Lillywhite]]) are highly paid because they can do things that no one else can do, and they are not available in the average bedroom. Recording isn't cheap, even with digital technology. Digital technology has replaced the 24 track Studor tape machine, but this was never the expensive part of recording. The expensive part is expertise. #The average musician can't make a living selling recordings on your website. The only artists that I am aware of who can generate a comfortable income this way are artists who established themselves by other means, or semi-professional artists who rely on resources other than their music. You need real marketing, promotion and distribution if you expect to quit your day job. You need the iTunes store, a manager, a relationship with a people who know marketing, a relationship with radio promoters and pockets deep enough to pay all these people. You can do it without a record company, but in the real world, this is expensive. You still need someone to loan you the money. #Recording artists (in the traditional system) needed to have a record deal ''before'' they went in the studio. Unless they're rich. The record company paid the (aforementioned) producer and engineer. #A composer used to send his score to a [[copyist]] to get parts, not a publishing company. And yes, ""copyist"" is no longer a profession, because composer can now create the parts on the office printer and bring them into the studio. (But again, ""copying"" was not the hard part of writing, performing and recording a symphony -- this is not where most of the time or money is going.) The publishing company makes sure the composer gets paid if they're composition is used by anyone else, and nothing has changed there.

Furthermore, the latter also goes on to say, ""The first public power station was the Edison Electric Light Station, built in London at 57, Holborn Viaduct, which started operation in January 1882.""

Talk:Power engineering,Article is lacking in specifics; too generalized,"I suspect that most people who click on this article title (people like me), are looking for information about being a Power Engineer (or a related discipline). Instead I got an article describing what a power plant is, and how electricity is moved around. Nothing about the discipline, just a bunch of {{tl|citation needed}} factoids about power generation and distribution. What do power engineers do? No idea, because that isn't what the article is about right now.  This article is too broad. It's like having an article titled ""horned toad"", and making the whole article variations on ""this is what an animal is"". No specific information, just super broad generalizations. This article needs to be heavily reworked. Right now it's almost unusable for the end reader.  A few useless - though not necessarily incorrect - factoids from the article: *""There are currently 56,000 power engineers currently employed in the province of Ontario."" *""The ability to easily transform the voltage of AC power is important for two reasons: Firstly, power can be transmitted over long distances with less loss at higher voltages."" *""Transformers play an important role in power transmission because they allow power to be converted to and from higher voltages."" *""Generation of electrical power is a process whereby energy is transformed into an electrical form."" '''<------------------------ *headdesk*''' *""Transmission circuits may be built either underground or overhead.""  Ok, that's enough.

On 11 April 2007 the edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_industry&diff=122031644&oldid=122019726 here] by [[User:Wackymacs]] analysed this data. I don't know about the U.S. figures, but $4.4 million US$ for Germany for ""the total amount of revenue brought by software and software services companies"" is completely wrong. SAP is based in Germany and they reported €2,018,000,000 global income for FY 2004 (per [http://www.sap.com/about/investor/reports/annualreport/2004/en/financials/information.html]). The Wikipedia article on [[SAP AG|SAP]] says they are the 3rd largest software vendor in the world, so it is misleading to say that ""The largest and most profitable of software companies are located in the United States"" in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_industry&direction=next&oldid=84464077 this edit]. The problem is that the [http://www.softwaremag.com/SW500/index.cfm?&CFID=19573323&CFTOKEN=6120279 Software Magazine 2007 listing] uses SAP's US location as the reference point. On this basis how can we trust any of their figures?  Until two years ago, Software Magazine was a US list. Only US revenues could be entered. Hence SAP entered only its US revenues at the time. At the moment their list is becoming more international and worldwide revenues can be entered. Still, as Software Magazine is sold in the US mostly, non-US software companies do not know it and do not seek listing in the Software 500.

In the original definition it stated that the Sports Industry “is the manufacturing of sport related goods, services, and ideas through the combination of sport activities with business, mass media, and politics.” My revisions would change this definition to say the Sports Industry is a market in which people, activities, business, and organizations involved in producing, facilitating, promoting, or organizing any activity, experience, or business enterprise focused on sports. It is the market in which the businesses are products offered to its buyers are sports related and may be goods, services, people, places, or ideas.  :I hope you got a good mark but I took it out again since it was confusing and inappropriate to have weirdly specific academese from particular papers of no special importance be the main focus of the article.

The topic is vast and I welcome further attempts to improve the area- but it has to be done out of knowledge of Textiles not out of an aim to 'just clean up the structure of en:wikipedia'. I failed to make sufficient headway, and a lot of my work was just copied from one article to another with the intention of culling bits and paraphrasing at a later date. The more books you used for reference- the more you discovered that just had to be included. Words in common usage like manufacturing and industry do have very precise meanings. Each justifies a long article. Neither are all inclusive. For manufacture we have fibre m., yarn m., fabric m., (weaving, knitting) processing of grey cloth. When we have the cloth, we have making up, which leads to clothing m. Industry is more problematic- the development of the Textile Industry ( before it becomes the Clothing Industry (Rag Trade) and the (Fashion Industry)) is the development of civilisation. Egypt and the fertile crescent- the birth of religions- then triangular trade and slavery. The birth of plastics. Cotton was the origin of the industrial revolution, and indeed industry. Read the sources including Collier. Yes try and merge- but we will have a more valuable product (wikipedia) if new articles are spawned first and we cull chunks and keep both T.Manufacturing and T.Industry.  Best of luck  folks-''  forwarded from ClemRutter by [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 04:16, 24 August 2022 (UTC)  [[User:Rjensen]]: Thanks a lot for relaying the message from ClemRutter. However, I must admit that it is still not very clear to me how it is possible to have two different articles that have so much content in common at this moment. Industry and Manufacturing is nearly synonymous in their broadest sense. In order to justify two different articles, we need to clearly define their scope. I don't see how that can be done organically and without a lot of forethought and deliberation. Plus the wiki model does not work well in such a premeditated way. Usually we grow an article and then fork out into some specific aspect. I propose that we merge everything into [[Textile industry]],  for now, and maybe have a manufacturing section within it, and then, if needed, we could recreate a [[Textile manufacturing]] fork article which might delve deeper into different manufacturing processes.
