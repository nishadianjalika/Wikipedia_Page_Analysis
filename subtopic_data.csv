Talk:Construction,Undue prominence on safety,"
Hi [[User:Dustfreeworld]]. You recently reverted a change I made to keep safety within a section about characteristics of of the construction industry. You assert ""Safety is not a “characteristic” of the industry. It’s a big problem caused by and also affecting the construction industry."" 

Previous edits of the construction article have created a logical hierarchy of four main headings: History, Sectors, Processes, Scale and characteristics. The latter's subsections included Economic activity, Employment, Sustainability, and (until you removed it) Safety. I do not share your view that this should be added to a main section of its own. Indeed, arguably, (a lack of) sustainability is an even greater problem with causes by and impacts upon the construction sector. I think the change you made warrants further discussion here with other editors to establish a consensus for your move. You clearly have a strong interest in air and dust pollution-related matters, but, in my view, your focus on these areas is potentially skewing the construction article by making safety more prominent than other issues ([[WP:Undue]]).

I propose to revert the change and invite you to discuss it here on the article Talk page. If there is a consensus for a separate section, all well and good, but if not, safety should remain within the Scale and characteristics section. Thank you for reading (I have also left a similar note on your User Talk page). [[User:Paul W|Paul W]] ([[User talk:Paul W|talk]]) 18:00, 15 September 2023 (UTC)

::It was part of a long series of dozens of edits in a major rewrite/reorganisation of the article (aiming to produce a level-3 vital article - see [[WP:Vital articles]] - that was consistent in its headings with other high level vital economy articles such as [[agriculture]] and [[manufacturing]]). The editing process was consciously conducted over multiple days over several weeks to allow other editors to contribute or raise matters via the Talk page (though none did) - so achieving consensus (per [[WP:CONACHIEVE]]) through editing.
::Please note I also tried to draw attention to the improvement process by adding a section - see ""Article improvement"" above - on this Talk page (started 5 May 2020, updated 26 June 2020) .

Talk:Consumer electronics,Merge timeline,"

This is a big problem, and I don't know how it can possibly be fixed because of its scope, but Wikipedia is full of this word. ""Consumer"" means ""one who consumes""{{snd}}and I have to wonder who's trying to ''consume'' (as in ''eat'') electronics. In these contexts, all that is really being communicated is ""it's something that people use""{{snd}}i.e. no useful information is being imparted.

See [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume] (and the entry below it, consumer). While this website is mostly talking about problems with the word related to software, it's not a term that we should be wanting to use to describe ourselves in the first place.

It may even be better to add a section and group Cogeneration with other topics of a similar nature, such as a discussion of the various remediation techniques used at modern coal fired power plants.

:::Fuel cells are like batteries in that they convert chemical energy to electrical energy, but they are different because batteries rely on chemicals built into the cell, while fuel cells consume fuel provided by an external source. I could see fuel cells being included, because eventually they may have a role in commercial electric generation, but batteries have no potential for such use, due to their high cost. (In principle, rechargeable batteries could be used to store energy for use during times of high demand, or to replace solar and wind energy at night or when the wind is calm, but as far as I know, this is not done except in small installations that are not connected to the grid.) --[[User:Gerry Ashton|Gerry Ashton]] 23:09, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

Compare that to the 0.25 megawatt fuel cell installation mentioned above it, it's hydrogen must be generated somehow and at a substantial loss in the [[Fuel_cell#Efficiency|cyclic efficiency]] of about 25% (H2O+electricity -> H2 -> H20+electricity) where as batteries range from [[Battery_%28electricity%29#Conversion_to_energy|66% to 99%]].

Sometimes fuel cell hydrogen is generated by water electrolysis, but fuel cells can and do use hydrocarbon fuels from a variety of sources. Plus, some schemes use hydrogen extracted from hydrocarbon fuels rather than from water. I think drawing a line between ""storage"" and ""generation"" is pretty artificial anyway. By the storage criterion, I could argue that coal fired power plants should be excluded because they aren't generating electricity. The energy in coal was stored by plants 200 million years ago, after all. If you can hook a voltmeter up to it and the needle moves, it's generating electricity. [[User:Tarchon|Tarchon]] 17:26, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

: Perhaps you are right, both batteries and fuel cells do generate or produce electricity.  I do consider coal, oil, and natural gas stored solar energy, so strictly speaking the stars are the only energy generators in the universe.  All the more reason to use the most direct forms of solar energy (Heat, PV, Wind, Hydro).  Even the heavy atoms in nuclear fuels are solar byproducts.  Having been burning fossil fuels so intensively for the last century we are in effect reversing the photosynthetic processes that occurred over the past hundreds of millennium, essentially reversing the time/age/balance of the earth natural systems, which seems like a pretty dangerous experiment to me.  Anyway, I'm not sure if there's a point other than if a fuel cell section is added then I would also be inclined to add a battery section.  --[[User:D0li0|D0li0]] 18:35, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

::The lead paragraph of the article clearly indicates the article is about commercial electric generation, which would exclude off-grid small scale electric generation, such as generators in automobiles, batteries used in portable devices (e.g. iPods), etc. It might be useful to put links to articles about small-scale generation in the See also section, if there are any such articles.

::: Batteries are just as commercial as power plants. Duracell isn't giving them away after all. I get the sense that the original article was intended to be about utility power generation, but if the article was supposed to be about that, that's what it should have been called. If an article has a generic title like ""electricity generation,"" it should be about electricity generation in general, not just the particular type of electricity generation that the original contributor had in mind. When I wrote the ""Other Methods"" section I hadn't been thinking about fuel cells, but that doesn't necessarily imply that they shouldn't be in there. I think the important thing in the ""Other Methods"" is to point out that there are a lot of different technologies for generating electricity and to provide links to the various types for more information, along with some brief and broad description of their respective roles in the world.

Saying that a solar panel is about 11% efficient at converting sunlight to electricity and a combined-cycle gas-turbine plant is 59% efficient at converting natural gas to electricity looks like information, but what really does it tell you? A hydro turbine may be 95% efficent at converting energy of falling water to electricity. I think it's only useful to compare efficiencies for the same primary energy source; then there's a correlation between efficiency and capital and operating costs.

::Wikipedia already has a [[Solar power satellite]] article. The [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}]] article cannot cover every possible technology for generating electricity. Even the individual sub-articles such as [[Solar energy]] and [[Wind power]] get so long that we have to split them up too. However, [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}]] could use a [[WP:NAVBOX|navigation template]] which would direct the reader to more details on the various technologies for generating electricity. The main drawback of solar power satellite technology is the enormous time and investment necessary before it could yield any power, when we already have plenty of unused [[desert]] land and rooftops on which to install solar collectors much more quickly, and above all incrementally, with proven technology. There is almost always a huge difference between proven and unproven technologies. With a proven technology, the costs and time requirements are knowable with high confidence. With unproven technologies, the actual costs and time requirements may differ enormously from preliminary estimates. That's why private investors greatly prefer proven technologies, whereas only governments are typically able to gamble large sums on unproven technologies. Time may become extremely important if the dire predictions of [[peak oil]] proponents bear out (see for example the [[Hirsch report]]) - e.g., once the full scale of the liquid fuel shortage becomes clear (in the worst-case scenario of petroleum depletion), civilization may lack the time and fossil energy resources necessary to mount a huge program of space power development.

The article uses the multiplier ""billion"". Unfortunately this is not a standard multiplier and may be confusing since the US and the UK have used different values for the multiplier billion. It would be good if the multipliers were replaced with unambiguous SI multipliers such as Giga or Tera.

Worryingly the article seems to be using the old British value of 10^12 for Billion and not the currently accepted 10^9 which has I understand always been used in the US and is now I believe the most widely accepted in the UK.

There is no sign of the principle of electricity formation being represented on the page.

Freely moving positive or negative subatomic particles are termed to be electric charges. A group of Electric charges is an Electric current, often referred to as Electricity. Basically electricity itself is a group of electric charges free from their atoms.
Anything with an electric or magnetic effect when coming in contact with a Conducting material attracts charge of opposite type towards it and thus forms electricity or electric charge.
Anodes, Cathodes, Magnets, and other magnetic or objects carrying free electric charge form electricity when in physical contact or premises form electricity.

The above mentioned description of the principles behind the formation must be according to me displayed on the article.

[[:Electricity generation]] → {{no redirect|Electric power generation}} – Electricity has a wide range of definitions and is not the topic of this article.

Talk:Electricity generation,Audition,"
I added the following sentence to lead, mostly as an audition: 

<blockquote>
There are also exotic and speculative methods to recover energy, such as proposed fusion reactor designs which aim to directly extract energy from intense magnetic fields generated by fast-moving charged particles generated by the fusion reaction (see magnetohydrodynamics).
</blockquote>

Given the global stakes involved for the current and future generation, I don't think this is a lead that should ruthlessly prioritize thinking inside the box, solely in terms of long established technologies. 

There's a certain innate tendency of encyclopedias to be backward looking (all the better to cite you with) and this form of authority is often warranted. 

However, in this case, the future mode of electric power generation on planet Earth is the Wild West right now (or should be), and so perhaps we should keep the open box front and center, even if it's so far but a tender, unlikely shoot sired by a [[DeLorean time machine|DeLorean]] and [https://www.gocomics.com/bloomcounty/2021/01/19 raisin-eating porcupines].

Talk:Power engineering,"""History"" Section","
This is my first participation in editing Wikipedia, so not too sure on protocol. I believe I have discovered a discrepancy between the History segment of this page and that of the [[Power station]] article regarding the World's first power station. The Power engineering article states, ""In 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at Godalming in England."", whilst the Power station article claims, ""The world's first power station was built by Sigmund Schuckert in the Bavaria town of Ettal and went into operation in 1878."" Furthermore, the latter also goes on to say, ""The first public power station was the Edison Electric Light Station, built in London at 57, Holborn Viaduct, which started operation in January 1882.""

I've only just discovered this and have not looked into which page is correct and I am unsure on the proper procedure for editing articles, though i would be happy to do so. [[User:Leroy is brown|Leroy is brown]] ([[User talk:Leroy is brown|talk]]) 01:42, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

Talk:Power engineering,Article is lacking in specifics; too generalized,"
I suspect that most people who click on this article title (people like me), are looking for information about being a Power Engineer (or a related discipline). Instead I got an article describing what a power plant is, and how electricity is moved around. Nothing about the discipline, just a bunch of {{tl|citation needed}} factoids about power generation and distribution. What do power engineers do? No idea, because that isn't what the article is about right now.

This article is too broad. It's like having an article titled ""horned toad"", and making the whole article variations on ""this is what an animal is"". No specific information, just super broad generalizations. This article needs to be heavily reworked. Right now it's almost unusable for the end reader.

A few useless - though not necessarily incorrect - factoids from the article:
*""There are currently 56,000 power engineers currently employed in the province of Ontario.""
*""The ability to easily transform the voltage of AC power is important for two reasons: Firstly, power can be transmitted over long distances with less loss at higher voltages.""
*""Transformers play an important role in power transmission because they allow power to be converted to and from higher voltages.""
*""Generation of electrical power is a process whereby energy is transformed into an electrical form."" '''<------------------------ *headdesk*'''
*""Transmission circuits may be built either underground or overhead.""

Ok, that's enough. Almost every sentence in the article is pointless and could be removed. Those are just a few randomly chosen examples. As I said: needs a rework, badly.

As someone who doesn't know much about power engineering, this article taught me nothing. Not good. My second step would be to leave a 3 sentence stub article. That would be everything I know about the subject that I can easily source (sourcing is much easier when you have considerable knowledge about a subject, and can sift good sources from the bad). On the plus side the article would then actually be about power engineering, and not about how ""electrical power is a process whereby energy is transformed into an electrical form"".
